Horn of Ammon is an interactive textual adventure meant to test and study password memorization through muscle-memory in a sightless game enviornment- one where no visual descriptions are to be seen and there are little to no visual references other than text.

Horn of Ammon's duration is roughly 30-45 minutes.

Afterwards, a questionnaire (which takes roughly 10 to 15 minutes to complete) can be taken:
