  text:
  - Hello! This is the Demonstration of the newly and improved inner workings of
    Horn of Ammon
  - Horn of Ammon is an interactive textual adventure designed to document and improve
    muscle-memory password memorization!
  - Of course that by itself sounds rather dull. However, this is a fully fledged
    game, not just a slightly-more-tollerable group work. You are fully welcomed
    and encouraged to engage in the game's story, characters and atmosphere!
  - To interact with the game, Choice Buttons will be used. These choice buttons
    appear at the end of certain text (will it be a dialogue or a scenario).  Here,
    try to interact with me!
  - That was an interaction you just did! The text you saw after pressing the button
    was a Response. Responses are unique to these scenes (aka Dialogues).
  - This is the end of the test dialogue. It's time to start the test scenario.
  exit_text:
  - Button
  - Wave Hello
  - Blow a Kiss
  - Do a Thumbs Up Gesture
  - Do Nothing
  scene_exits:
  - '[1,2,3,4][4,4,4,4]'
  responses:
  - This is the default response.
  - You wave hello... but the game cannot wave back.
  - You blow a kiss to the game. The game blushes.
  - You do a Thumbs-Up, the significantly-cooler hello. The game now thinks you are
    pretty cool too.
  - You do nothing... and the game notices (you still pressed the button, dummy).
