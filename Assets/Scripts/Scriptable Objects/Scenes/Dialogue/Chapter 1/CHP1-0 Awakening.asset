  - "<b><align=\"center\"=>TUTORIAL: Attempts & Attempt Timer</b></align>\nEach of
    your attempts to progress through Horn of Ammon has a limited time for you to
    unveil its mystery. The timer is not related to actual time spent in game, rather
    certain actions in the game world cause the timer to decrease. You may have noticed
    that, playing regularly and checking everything will cause the time you have
    to run out rather quickly. To check the current timer\u2019s progress, you may
    listen to the music in the background\u2014 which changes based on the timer\u2019s
    value."
  - "When your timer runs out, you will begin the game again from here\u2014 at the
    start of Chapter 1. In addition to that, talking to others usually does not cause
    the timer to decrease, only when you or another takes a <i>physical action</i>.
    While not always extremely precise, this is a good rule of thumb."
  - "However, an extremely important distinction needs to be made: nothing within
    the game world changes as you take your attempts. All passcodes remain the exact
    same. You are encouraged \u2013 and intended to \u2013 not check the solution
    for each puzzle every time you begin a chapter: instead, use your knowledge aquired
    from previous attempt to progress through the chapters while saving as many actions
    as possible!"
  - If you find the text on screen becoming repetitive, remember that you can change
    the speed of text in the options menu and you can skip writing text by pressing
    SPACEBAR as the text is being written.
  - Just remember there is no score or bonus for completing the game in a low amount
    of attempts. Take all the time you need and good luck!
