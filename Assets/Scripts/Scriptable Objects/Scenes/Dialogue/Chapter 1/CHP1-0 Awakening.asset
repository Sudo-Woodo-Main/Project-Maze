  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYour memory is failing you. Stop and focus.\u201D</color>"
  - "<b><align=\"center\"=>TUTORIAL: Attempts & Attempt Timer</b></align>\nEach of
    your attempts to progress through Horn of Ammon has a limited time for you to
    unveil its mystery. The timer is not related to actual time spent in game, rather
    certain actions in the game world cause the timer to decrease. You may have noticed
    that, playing regularly and checking everything will cause the time you have
    to run out rather quickly. To check the current timer\u2019s progress, you may
    listen to the music in the background\u2014 which changes based on the timer\u2019s
    value."
  - "When your timer runs out, you will begin the game again from here.\nHowever,
    an extremely important distinction needs to be made: nothing within the game
    world changes as you take your attempts. All passcodes remain the exact same.
    You are encouraged \u2013 and intended to \u2013 not check the solution for each
    puzzle every time you begin a chapter: instead, use your knowledge aquired from
    previous attempt to progress through the chapters while saving as many actions
    as possible!\r\n"
  - "Additionally, given that there is a lot of text to go through in the game you
    can ask the game to \u2018Test your Memory\u2019!"
  - "This is an opportunity for you to play through the game faster. Iif you can
    remember the passcodes of a certain chapter, you may skip through said chapter
    by entering the passwords. However, this does account for text you may have not
    read yet, thus you won\u2019t be skipped to, say, the start of Chapter 3 if you
    have yet to read the text between Chapter 2 and Chapter 3! If you want to re-read
    older text, you may also begin from Chapter 1 again. "
  - In addition to that, If you find the text on screen becoming repetitive, remember
    that you can change the speed of text in the options menu and you can skip writing
    text by pressing SPACEBAR as the text is being written.
  - Just remember there is no score or bonus for completing the game in a low amount
    of attempts. Take all the time you need and good luck!
  - Now, what do you want to do?
  - 'Your memory rapidly goes through the motions played in front of you previously:
    your investigations, your discoveries and the secrets that are no longer such.
    Now in front of you stand two holes in the wall.'
  - 'You place hand on the left slot. Once again, the slit feels just the right size
    for an arm to fit through. With a hum, the wall responds:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CMy Emperor, have you come to honor the dead?
    You are the only one that may proceed.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CProve to me you are Dearion. Speak aloud
    this passcode: The Initial of the Court Wizard. The number associated with her
    death. The initial of her weapon of choice. And the years she had when you first
    met her. (All letters need to be Uppercase!)\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "The gate hums back: <mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CIncorrect Passcode.\u201D
    </mspace></color>"
  - "The gate hums: <mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CCorrect Passcode. Please,
    unlock the next one to progress.\u201D </mspace></color >"
  - 'You insert your hand on the right slit, which fits your arm perfectly. With
    a hum the wall responds:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CMy Emperor, have you come to honor the dead?
    You are the only one that may proceed.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CProve to me you are Dearion. Speak aloud
    this passcode: The Initial of your Right Hand. The number associated with his
    death. The initial of his Prized Shield. And the points he got when he won it
    from you. (All letters need to be Uppercase!)\u201D </mspace></color>"

  - You brush through the events of Chapter 1, now locked in your mind. Now in front
    of you stand a pedistal
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\"Please pronounce the first passcode\u2014 the
    one low to the ground.\"</color>"

    the years she had when her eternal slumber started.\"</color>\n"
