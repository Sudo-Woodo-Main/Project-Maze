  - Before we start, there are a few things that you must know about this game.
  - "This story is a work of fiction. All references to names, characters, people,
    businesses, places, events and incidents in this game are the product of the
    author\u2019s imagination\u2014 which has been influenced over the course of
    the years by multiple, different sources. "
  - "Any resemblance to real-life objects, places, religions, people or events is
    purely coincidental and in no-way representative of actual history or events,
    as well as not being a counterpart of any of the former\u2014 neither in satire,
    critical commentary or any other intentionally referential form."
  - Sometimes, a story is just a story. Do you understand this?
  - "It is important you understand that none of the events in the game are real
    \u2013 or meant to reppresent anything real \u2013 You will be shown those same
    warnings again. "
  - "This story may contain unsettling imagery for some. Themes such as false incarceration,
    claustrophobia, torment and disadvantage are discussed at length in the story.
    It\u2019s important that you understand that, by agreeing to play this game,
    you are in no way bound to play it through completion."
  - "Without permission, you are free to leave whenever you desire. However, the
    themes may push you away from completing the game, or even playing it in the
    first place. It\u2019s important to know whether these themes are a deal-breaker
    for you."
  - Do you still want to play the game?
  - You will be returned to the main title screen. Let the developer know that you
    do not intend to undertake the playtest.
  - One last thing.
  - "This game will save some data of your playthrough. Data will be used to compile
    information about the effectivness of the game as a teaching and instructional
    tool, as well as how effectively its premise \u2013 a narration heavy game with
    little to no visual reference \u2013 works in the way of password memorization."
  - Data regarding your playthrough will be saved and safely kept according to GDPR
    standards. Additionally, no sensitive data (such as age, sex, etc.) will be kept.
    Only questions regarding your status on cybersecurity, videogame activity and
    enjoyment will be asked for the purposes of creating accurate charts in the dissertation.
    These questions are in no way meant to discriminate or objectify you and are
    only relevant within the confines of the research question.
  - Do you agree to the game saving your data for research purposes?
  - If the game still entices you, you may still play it. Your playthrough will not
    be used for development and research purposes. As a lover of games, it would
    sadden me knowing that you want to not play the game exclusively because of this.
    Enjoy your playthrough regardless.
  - 'I will show you the warning about data saving again then. '
  - 'Very well. The game is about to start. '
