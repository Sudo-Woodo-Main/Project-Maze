  - Hello and welcome to Horn of Ammon! Before we start with the game, there are
    a few clarification I must make regarding the nature, purpose and contents of
    the game. Press <b>SPACEBAR</b> to continue.
  - You must press <b>SPACEBAR</b> whenever the text has finished displaying on your
    screen to progress further. You can also press <b>SPACEBAR</b> whenever the text
    is being written to skip immediately to the completed text.
  - The game makes uses of <b>BUTTONS</b> to progress through the game. These <b>BUTTONS</b>
    are shown in the lower-side of the screen <i>(for now, ignore the two buttons
    to the bottom sides of the screen!)</i>. Whenever there is a choice to be made,
    the game will grant you up to four possible choices. These choices allow you
    to progress through the game.
  - "For example, now you\u2019ll be given a few choices. These choices appear once
    you press <b>SPACEBAR</b> after certain blocks of text. For example, the game
    might ask you which flavour of Ice-Cream is your favourite between a few choices\u2026"
  - "As you can see, the game gave you a different answer, based on your choices!
    Not every instance of text will result in you making choices, but <b>be sure
    to value your options when presented with one</b>. Time in game only passes when
    changing dialogue so don\u2019t feel pressured to pick an answer quickly: you
    may reflect for as long as you like."
  - "I brought to your attention two additional <b>BUTTONS</b> before. The button
    to the bottom-right is the <b>SAVE GAME BUTTON </b>. If you don\u2019t feel like
    playing the game in an entire session, you may decide to save and continue later.
    To load a saved game, simply click the \u201CLoad Game\u201D <b> BUTTON </b>
    in the Main Menu instead of the \u201CNew Game\u201D one."
  - The other <b>BUTTON</b>, to your bottom-left, is the <b>OPTIONS BUTTON</b>. Here
    you can modify some settings of the game to be more to your liking. Maybe the
    music has been a bit too loud, or the typing sound not to your liking, maybe
    the text has been too big or has been moving too slow. You can access this menu
    from both the Game and the Main Menu. Options are saved locally and do not need
    to be reset every time you open the game.
  - Now that you know the controls, there are some warnings and information that
    needs to be said about the game.
  - "The game tries to tell a story for you to enjoy. This story the game presents
    is a <b>work of fiction</b>. All references to names, characters, people, buisnesses,
    places, events and incidents in this game are the product of the author\u2019s
    imagination\u2014 which has been influenced over the course of the years by multiple,
    different sources: some whom may be familiar to you, others unfamiliar."
  - "Any resemblance to real-life objects, places, religions, people or events is
    <b>purely coincidental</b> and in no-way representative of actual history or
    events, as well as not being a counterpart of any of the former\u2014 neither
    in satire, critical commentary or any other intentionally referential form."
  - <i>Sometimes, a story is just a story</i>. <b>Do you understand this?</b>
  - "It is important you understand that none of the events in the game are real
    \u2013 or meant to reppresent anything real \u2013 You will be shown those same
    warnings again. "
  - "As a story, it treats various themes and scenarios. However, the story may contain
    unsettling imagery for some. Themes such as <b>false incarceration</b>, <b>claustrophobia</b>,
    <b>loss</b> and <b>disadvantage</b>, as well as <b>implied physical violence</b>
    are discussed, even if only in passing, in the story. It\u2019s important that
    you understand that, by agreeing to play this game, you are in no way bound to
    play it through completion."
  - "As a safety measure, you are free to leave whenever you desire, without any
    permission required. However, the themes may push you away from completing the
    game, or even playing it in the first place. <b>It\u2019s important to know whether
    these themes are a deal-breaker for you.</b>"
  - Do you <i>still want to play</i> the game, <b>knowing of its themes and contents?</b>
  - 'You will be returned to the main title screen. Let the developer know that you
    do not intend to undertake the playtest. '
  - There is  <b>one last thing</b> I must warn you about before you begin playing.
  - "This game will <b>save some data of your playthrough.</b> Data will be used
    to compile information about the effectivness of the game as a teaching and instructional
    tool, as well as how effectively its premise \u2013 <i> a narration heavy game
    with little to no visual reference </i>\u2013 works in the way of password memorization."
  - "In addition to that, upon the game\u2019s completion, you will be presented
    with a <b>questionnaire</b> to compile regarding your experience with the game.
    The game is estimated to be 30 to 45 minutes in length, while the questionaire
    is 5-10 minutes. In the <b>questionnaire</b>, only questions regarding your status
    on cybersecurity, videogame activity and enjoyment of Horn of Ammon will be asked
    for the purposes of creating accurate charts in the working dissertation. <i>These
    questions are in no way meant to discriminate or objectify you and are only relevant
    within the confines of the research question.</i>"
  - Data regarding your playthrough will be saved and safely kept according to <b>GDPR
    standards</b>. <i>Your data will be safely encrypted and only kept under your
    accord.</i> Additionally, no sensitive data (such as age, sex, etc.) will be
    kept nor asked for.
  - Do you agree to the game <b>saving your data for research purposes?</b>
  - If the game still entices you, <b>you may still play it</b>. However, <b>Your
    playthrough will not be used for development and research purposes </b>. As a
    lover of games myself, I do not want to force you to play only to gather data.
    Enjoy your playthrough regardless. <i>Data Gathering will be disabled.</i> If
    you desire it to re-enable it, you may click the <b>Data Gathering Toggle</b>
    in the <b>OPTIONS</b> menu.
  - I will show you the warnings about data saving again.
  - Data Gathering will be enabled from this point onwards.
  - The warnings and tutorial section is finished and the game is about to start!
  - "But\u2026 <i>where</i> to start? There are many interesting points in this story\u2026"
  - Oh. I know!
  - "Let\u2019s start this story at <b>its most important moment\u2026</b>"
