  - "\u201CFLETCHER! THOU HAVE BEEN SUMMONED BY THE WILL OF THE EMPEROR OF THIS LAND
    TO HIS MAJESTIC COURT ON THE ACCOUNT OF HIGH TREASON! YOU MAY SURRENDER AND COME
    WITH US OR- AND MAY THE GODS HAVE MERCY ON YOUR SOUL IF YOU DO- RETALIATE AND
    FACE THE IMPERIAL GUARD\u2019S WRATH!\u201D"
  - "Treason? The Gods? The Emperor Himself? Surely, there must be a misunderstanding\u2026"
  - "You are stunned by this information. Accused of treason by the Emperor himself\u2026
    and\u2026 a process?"
  - "The shrill voice lightly replies: \u201CYou will know in due time, Fletcher.
    For know I need you to follow me.\u201D"
  - You realize that standing in this cabin will do you no good. You have not bothered
    anyone ever since the day you were born and surely you have not conspired against
    the Emperor himself! What ridicolousness. Following this high-pitched agent of
    the Emperor may be your only option right this moment but you are sure this is
    but a misunderstanding.
  - "In your mind various options and possibilities fly: could have it been that
    your work was poor quality? You scoff at the though\u2014 you know your craft
    and know the quality of your work in unmatched. Was it a joke or song blurted
    out after one too few tankards at the tavern? I mean\u2026 if that counted as
    treason they would have to arrest the whole town."
  - "As you have been thinking in place \u2013 almost distracted from your current
    circumstances \u2013 you hear the light cracking of your cabin\u2019s door bravely
    withstanding the borderline-battering ram-strength of the Agent\u2019s \u201Cknocking\u201D:
    so furious and powerful that you feel light vibrations from your cozy seat."
  - You move towards your door and, after taking some time to locate all the locking
    pins, you open the door.
  - "A smell of sweat, horse and leather immediately hits your nostrils, as the man\u2019s
    riding must have taken a few days\u2014 and judging by the pungent odor, he did
    not make any stops along the road. Swiftly, a boney hand reaches for yours: cold
    and wet, the shock hits you like lighting. Immediately, you move to retract your
    hand but the man\u2019s grasp is firm and prevents you from moving your left
    hand \u2013 or arm \u2013 further. \u201CI\u2019m glad you decided to agree to
    this, Fletcher. The Gods only know what your process would have looked like otherwise.\u201D"
  - "As he says this, you begin to pick up the faint smell of steel and gunpowder
    from the man: hearing the light clanking of metal-on-metal makes you imagine
    a pistol\u2026 but multiplied tenfold.  A brace of flintlock pistols, one of
    which would have surely been your judge, jury and executioner."
  - "Without even time to think, you feel you are being tugged into the cold drizzle
    outside. The almost-freezing temperatures are making you shiver and rattle your
    teeth. After an exasperated sigh, the Agent releases the grip on your wrist and,
    immediately after, you feel the sudden warmth of a wool blanket he threw to you.
    \u201CWell, you are all set and ready. It\u2019s time for you to go.\u201D"
  - So, this is how your story starts.

  - Default Text

  - '"My trial? Explain yourself!"'

  - "\u201CIt takes me some time\u2026\u201D"
  - "\u201CI don\u2019t hear my horse.\u201D"
  - "\u201CThank you for the blanket.\u201D"
  - "\u201CAm I supposed to ride with you?\u201D"
  - Make a break for it!

  responses:
  - Default Response
  - "A shrill shriek returns to you: \u201CTHIS IS FOR THE EMPEROR\u2019S COURT TO
    DECIDE DURING YOUR DUE TRIAL, FLETCHER. I AM BUT HERE TO RETRIEVE YOU IN HIS
    NAME.\u201D"
  - "The shrilling voice barks back: \u201CARE YOU ALSO DEAF, FLETCHER? YOU ARE ACCUSED
    OF TREASON AND IF YOU DO NOT OPEN YOUR DOOR THIS INSTANT I SHALL SEE THAT DURING
    THE TRIAL YOU ARE EXECUTED FOR IT AS WELL!\u201D"
  - "In a piercing tone, the man decrys: \u201CI DO NOT HAVE TO EXPLAIN THE EMPEROR\u2019S
    WILL, FLETCHER. YOU, IF TRULY A LAW-ABIDING, NON-CONSPIRING AND UN-TRETCHEROUS
    INDIVIDUAL, SHOULD KNOW SUCH. YOUR ATTUTUDE MAKES IT HARD TO PROVE SUCH IN THE
    TRIAL\u201D."
  - "The once-screechy speech turns into a deafening shout somehow an octave higher:
    \u201CYOU THINK ME A FOOL, FLETCHER? I KNOW YOU ARE IN THE HOUSE, I CAN SEE THE
    LIGHT OF YOUR FIREPLACE. YOUR MOCKERY OF HIS IMPERIAL AUTHORITY AND HIS TRUSTED
    SERVANTS IS NOT GOOD FOR YOUR TRIAL."
  - 'You shout back: "The trial? Explain!". A moment of silence follows, and an exhasperated
    sigh right after.'
  - "\u201CI\u2019m coming!\u201D- you blurt out, hoping the sound will not be drawned
    by the siege-weapon that is the Agent\u2019s knocking. You hope this may be,
    at the very least, enough to save your door from certain distruction."
  - "You calmly say: \u201CLet me finish my soup first\u201D. After a second passes,
    you discover that, beyond any possibility, the Agent\u2019s knocking has somehow
    become even more furious and faster. Alongside the screeching sounds coming from
    behind your door, it sounds more like a rabid wolf than a man. For your and your
    soup\u2019s incolumity, you decide to get up and open the door\u2014 without
    your precious soup in hand."
  - "\u201CPlease, don\u2019t break my door!\u201D \u2013 you decry. And from the
    other side of the door, the shrill voice replies: \u201CPLEASE DON\u2019T TEST
    MY PATIENCE FLETCHER. OPEN THE DOOR. NOW.\u201D. You realize that opening the
    door is your only chance to avoid being executed right in your very home, however
    the incessant battering assault seems to have stopped for now."
  - "\u201CIt takes me some time\u2026\u201D \u2013 you say, in a sad and exhausted
    tone. The man stops his incessant knocking and blurts out: \u201CI\u2026 must
    apologize. But you best be opening this door, or else!\u201D"
  - "\u201CI don\u2019t hear my horse.\u201D You proclaim, trying to perk your ears
    in hope that you might have just missed it hiding amongst the other sounds. \u201CYou
    don\u2019t have one. You walk.\u201D The agent barks with thinly-veiled impatience
    in his tone. You want to object, but the sound of the flintlock pulling back
    is making you reconsider. Walking will have to do."
  - "\u201CThank\u2026 you for the blanket\u201D, you meekly reply. Another sigh
    leaves the agent\u2019s mouth. \u201CYes, yes: \u2018thank yous\u2019 and all
    that. That was the last courtesy I could spare. Start walking.\u201D"
  - "\u201CAm I supposed to ride with you?\u201D you say towards your captor sneeringly.
    \u201CHah! Prisoners do not ride alongside the officers, they walk. You better
    start.\u201D"
  - "This may be your one and only opportunity for escape. You take in a few deep
    breaths and then start runni\u2026 but before you make any distance you hear
    the thundering roar of the flintlock pistol crack behind you, the trail of the
    bullet makes the air next to your right ear uncomfortably hot. \u201CThe next
    one will be for you if you try that again. Start walking.\u201D"
