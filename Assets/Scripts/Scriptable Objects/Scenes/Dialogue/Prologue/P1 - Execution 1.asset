  - You were wandering the halls of the Imperial Palace, hoping to receive audience
    with the Emperor himself. Unfortunately enough, <i>your prayers have been answered.</i>
  - A guards spots you before you notice its presence. With a shout, many more are
    called to your position. You make no attempt to resist, in case your arrest turns
    into your death.
  - One by one, a number of guards subdue you and then forcibly start moving you.
    Once again, you pose no resistance to them.
  - "You hear your heart racing in your ears. You cannot see where you are being
    dragger, only the occasional noise of your chains being shaken and moven. At
    least two individuals are dragging you, one by each arm. You hear the clattering,
    metallic footsteps of the Emperor\u2019s Holy Guard behind you, their armor as
    loud as cracking thunder. You can\u2019t distinguish how many individuals are
    behind you, only that they are not few."
  - "Your head is spinning and you feel nauseous. But this is the moment you have
    been preparing for. This is where you make your case for freedom\u2026 for survival.
    To whomever Gods you give reverence, you let out a quiet prayers. The guards
    do not seem to mind this action and proceed with their grim task."
  - "Initially distant, you start to hear the chittering sounds of the Imperial Court
    become louder and louder. At least you aren\u2019t being dragged to the gallows
    yet. The smell of expensive perfumes and burning wax fills the air. You cannot
    see, but judging by how far the sounds still feel you can determine that the
    room you are being carried in is quite big."
  - "After a few seconds, the guards release you. With a shove, you are brought to
    your knees. Istinctively, you attempt to get up again, only for the back of your
    neck to meet a cold, steel point. There will be no attempts of getting up that
    won\u2019t result in early death."
  - Watching the scene, the crowd becomes rowdier and more than whispering, they
    are gossiping about your situation.
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CSilence.\u201D</color> \u2013 a voice, loud and clear,
    at best 10 meters in front of you, shouts."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI see you came willingly at least. However, this doesn\u2019t
    change the purpose of this meeting: this is the trial for your execution.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CAs by the power the charge of Emperor of the Vast Lands
    grants me, I will grant you a fair trial.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201COr\u2026at least, as fair as one such as you deserves.\u201D</color>"
  - "At this sentence, the crowd erupts in laughter: mocking your current condition\u2026
    it won\u2019t be easy to win them over, much less not to make a spectacle about
    this."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CNo introductions on your end will be needed. Your nature
    is known to all those partecipating to the trial.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201CEven those not partecipating know your name\u2026 you are
    basically a super-star! As famous as the Emperor themselves! I\u2019d know there
    are people that would\u2026 KILL \u2026 to be in your position.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\"<size=150%>Ahah<size=125%>ahh<size=100%>ahah<size=75%>ahah<size=50%>ahah<size=25%>ahah<size=12%>aha\u2026<size=100%>\"</color>"
  - A familiar voice emerges, A cackling laughter coming from in front of you. The
    Jester, and Advisor, to the Emperor himself.
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CJester\u2026 this is no joking matter. We have finally
    found who we were looking for\u201D.</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CThe one who hosts Ammon. The Great Traitor.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CVery well, Great Traitor, let\u2019s begin. To start with,
    do you have anything to say for yourself?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CMh. It appears you do not understand your predicament.\u201D</color>
    The emperor calls for the Jester."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CJester, are you sure this individual is the Great Traitor?\u201D</color>
    You can hear a sarcastic and mocking tone in the Emperor\u2019s voice."
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201COhhhhh\u2026 as sure as you are Emperor, my Emperor. Although
    I\u2019m not sure of much these days\u2026 for example I\u2019m not sure the
    Great Traitor will make it out of here alive\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\"<size=150%>Ahah<size=125%>ahh<size=100%>ahah<size=75%>ahah<size=50%>ahah<size=25%>ahah<size=12%>aha\u2026<size=100%>\"</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CYou may not see it, Traitor, but the Mark of Ammon is on
    you. From this point onwards I suggest paying heed to your words and take good
    care of saying the truth. Least this trial turns into an execution.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CDo not make a mockery authority I posses, nor the loyalty
    of my subjects. If you truly were loyal to me, you\u2019d understand the benefits
    of ending your life, here and now.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201COh-oh! I think you may be right, your Majesty! See how
    he\u2019s bowing? The Traitor may already be practicing the correct form for
    the chopping block!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\"<size=150%>Ahah<size=125%>ahh<size=100%>ahah<size=75%>ahah<size=50%>ahah<size=25%>ahah<size=12%>aha\u2026<size=100%>\"</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CSpare me from this pathetic show. For how harrowing and
    sad your death will be, its service to the kingdom is a price I\u2019m more than
    willing to pay.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201CYeesh. And I thought my fake crying was bad.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\"<size=150%>Ahah<size=125%>ahh<size=100%>ahah<size=75%>ahah<size=50%>ahah<size=25%>ahah<size=12%>aha\u2026<size=100%>\"</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CYou do realize the situation you are in, right? Silence
    will only damn you further.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CIn any case, the Great Traitor is here for all the court
    to admire.\u201D </color>"
  - "The once hushed whispers turn to a roaring cacophony coming from your sides\u2026
    it feels like you are an exotic animal in a cage, oogled at by passerbyes and
    seekers of the curious and unusual. And the chaos signals it is time to put on
    a show."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI must ask something of you first, Great Traitor. What
    are your thoughts right now? To whom are your prayers directed towards?\u201D
    </color>"
  - "The court\u2019s words are many and confused. They are trying to understand
    your character, your motivation, your reasoning. While you can\u2019t grasp any
    solid words, a few of the more frequent one become clear amidst the chaos."
  - "<color=#d9d9d9>\n\u201CTraitor\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CDid they betray the Emperor?
    They seem lost\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CThat is all an act! They clearly are allied
    with the evil Ammon!\u201D\r\n\u201CAmmon\u2026 what an awful power for such
    an evil god\u2026\u201D\r\n\u201CThe Traitor will pay for this!\u201D\r\n\n</color>"
  - "You feel that whatever control you have over this situation is slipping away
    from you fast. If you can\u2019t quickly make a case for yourself, the Court
    will ask for your head. You need to think of something that would convince the
    Court to at the very least hear you\u2026"
  - " Even with the best odds\u2026 No, you cannot afford for a defeatist act, you
    NEED to think, FAST."
  - " You can\u2019t remember much of what happened before but you know that, hidden
    somewhere deep within your memories, there is the solution for this problem. 
    But\u2026 you can\u2019t seem to get to them. "
  - "<color=#00e64d> \u201CThe situation seems bleak but you must not panic.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d> \u201CYour memory of the events that transpired will save you,
    Keeper.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d> \u201CYou must simply tap into it once more. Now, reach deep
    into your mind and share with Emperor Dearion the memories he has lost. The memories
    that will save his life, the life of his subjects, the life of this kingdom\u2026
    and your life too, Keeper.\u201D </color>"
  - 'You pull yourself from the ground and, standing as tall as the guard allows
    you to, you profess these words:'
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201CMh.. It appears newfound resolve has sparked in the Great
    Traitor\u2026 or should we say Keeper? Am I correct? I know I\u2019m correct\u2026

  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CJESTER! Is this some elaborate prank? I do not appreciate
    it! You have overstepped your boundries as advisor to the Emperor.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201COh merely a simple jest, your Majesty. But, I suggest that
    we let the Great Traitor speak for themselves. If they truly are lying\u2026
    the worth of their lies will be compared to the wealth of knowledge of the court
    and, of course, your Own memories.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201CAfter all\u2026 you were there.\u201D </color>"

  - "The court erupts in a series of conjectures and tall-tales, meek attempts to
    interpret the meaning of your words, the reaction of the Emperor and most importantly,
    the Jester\u2019s own words. Hushered whispers follow about the Emperor, about
    the events that transpired during his reign, about the great victories he conquered
    and the smashing losses he suffered. While the guards try their best to husher
    everyone, only the word of the Emperor may actually quiet down the court."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CSilence.\u201D </color> The Emperor\u2019s voice is steady
    but audibly shaken by your words."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI have decided to grant you the time to explain yourself
    to this court. You will have a fair trial after all. However\u2026 if I do not
    like your answers\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI. WILL. KILL YOU. And, as Emperor I also decree that the
    Jester, who loves to joke about conspiring against me, suffers the same end.\u201D
    </color>"
  - 'A shocked gasp comes from the Court. Their whispers and speculations find more
    and more solid ground to stand: the Jester is an ally to the Great Traitor!'
  - "<color=#7094db>\"<size=150%>Eheh... Eheh... Eheh<size=125%>eheh<size=100%>eheh<size=75%>eheh<size=50%>eheh<size=25%>eheh<size=12%>eheh\u2026<size=100%>\"</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201CThis game is becoming more interesting by the minute! I\u2019d
    gladly play it, my Emperor!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201CWell\u2026 now it\u2019s up to you, Keeper. Tell to Emperor
    Dearion the truths he has forgotten.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CWell\u2026 Begin to tell your story. Possibly from the
    moment you entered the Imperial Palace\u2019s Secret Halls.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DFrom now on it\u2019s up to you, Keeper.\u201D </color>
    \u2013 The voice of Ammon once again speaks in your mind."
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI will help you relive the events of today. However, I
    cannot remember them for you. I will allow you to tap into all those memories
    until they become crystal clear.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DNow, Keeper. Lend me your thoughts and I will make them
    once again real for you.\u201D</color>"

  - Default Response
  - "You muster up the courage to speak. You ask the Emperor what the term \u201CGreat
    Traitor\u201D means, and why you are being called such."
  - From your crouched form, you attempt to form a humble bow towards the direction
    of the voice. You utter words of loyalty and fidelity to the Emperor and his
    court.
  - 'Getting somehow closer to the ground, your form becomes compressed and small:
    you beg for your life in front of the court, almost to the point of tears.'
  - Either in defiance or shock, you do not utter a sound. Your form does not change
    and you wait for the Emperor to speak again.
  - You attempt to get the Emperor's attention, but your voice is silenced immediatly
    by a much larger source of noise
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CA choice that I understand well. There are some Gods that
    deserve praise, others that do not. The one that has marked you, for example,
    is owed only insults and blasphemies. If you truly are cursed by Them only in
    passing, then you must know how evil such a God can be.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CHow banal. Your familiy is lucky to not have you around
    anymore, for this Empire \u2013 your family included \u2013 should not have to
    tolerate the terror that is Ammon. I pray only that you realize this in time
    for your death.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CYou won\u2019t win me over with insincere begs and nags.
    Your time is short and you best be making the best use of it: if you truly believe
    crying to my deaf ears is such, then I\u2019d think you haven\u2019t much of
    a case for yourself.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CBlasphemous to the end, I see! I\u2019d wager that Ammon
    would hate to see such a \u2018pious\u2019 and \u2018holy\u2019 person\u2019s
    head on a PIKE. If you are trying to get me riled up for some sick scheme or
    trick, you are succeding.\u201D </color>"
  - In your mind possibilities are rushing; each carefully calculated, each torn
    apart by your current predicament.
  - A sense of panic overwhelms you. Your memory feels scattered and lost. Thinking
    is not an option in your current state of mind.
  - "You zone out the sounds of the Imperial Court, of the Emperor\u2019s orders\u2026
    and focus. In this state of mind, words that are not your own enter your mind."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CW-What? How\u2026 how do you know about that? How do you
    know about ANY of that?\u201D </color>"
