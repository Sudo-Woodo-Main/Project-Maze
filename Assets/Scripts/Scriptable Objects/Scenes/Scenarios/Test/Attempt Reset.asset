  - "Hey, you. You\u2019re finally awake. "
  - You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that Imperial Ambush,
    same as us.
  - "Damn you, Stormcloaks. Skyrim was fine until you came along. The Empire was
    nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that horse
    and been halfway to Hammerfell. You there. You and me \u2014 we shouldn't be
    here. It's these Stormcloaks the Empire wants."
  - We're all brothers and sisters in binds now, theif.
  - Shut up back there!
  - And what's wrong with him?
  - Watch your tongue! You're speaking to Ulfirc Stormcloak, the True High King!
  - Ulfric? The Jarl of Windhelm? The Leader of the Rebellion? But if they captured
    you... oh Gods, were are they taking us?
  - I don't know where we are going, but Sovengarde awaits.
  - " No, this can\u2019t be happening. This isn\u2019t happening."
  - Hey, what village are you from, horse thief?
