  text:
  - This is a scenario to test the attempt reset function.
  - Right now, the timer has been set to 5. This is to make this scenario (and act)
    end as soon as possible.
  - The rest of the text past the 5th element shouldn't matter at all. The player
    will black out before they reach it.
  - This is because every single one of these text elements has a "t" flag on them,
    making the timer tick down by 1.
  - Normally in the game only a few elements would actually have the t flag, to physically
    prevent a player from repeating actions (such as checking passwords too frequently).
  - This is to create intended and designed repetition in a non artificial way, creating
    a unique gameplay component that the users can actively enjoy without hindering
    them.
  - Multiple attempts can lead the players to making different choices which in turn
    will give them some extra unique hindsights on the game's story.
  - By now, the game should have already ended.
