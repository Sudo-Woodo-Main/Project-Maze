  - Once again, you jolt awake. Such dreams have been recurring to you for quite
    a while. Ever since a few years ago, the voice in the back of your mind became
    ever louder.
  - The more it became difficult to zone it out, the harder it became to see. At
    this point, you almost barely remember what things looked like before.
  - "You know of the voice that has been speaking to you. You know that it is powerful\u2014
    you know it is forbidden."
  - "<b><i>\u201CThey who listen to treatcherous voices in their mind shall pay with
    their lives\u201D</i></b>  said the royal decree. You fancy keeping your head
    on your shoulders; where it oughta be."
  - "At least you are awake now. Bad dreams can\u2019t reach you in your bed unless
    you are sleeping."
  - ...
  - Or so you thought.
  - A piercing thought enters your mind. Like a migrane, it feels as if your head
    is being split in two with an axe. You can barely steady your breathing.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DKeeper\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou are finally awake.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI am the profane god of memory, Ammon. You must listen
    to me as you are the only hope of these lands.\u201D</color>"
  - With a mixture of shock and fear, any words you want to say simply do not come
    out of your mouth. The pain makes it hard to speak.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DEmperor Dearion rules over this lands with an iron fist.
    This is what you remember. This is what everyone remembers. This is what Dearion
    himself remembers.</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThis kingdom is called \u2018the Cruel\u2019 because of
    its grueling work and its endless turmoil. Preparations for a war, says Emperor
    Dearion, but against whom?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThey who speak their mind against the Emperor himself shall
    pay with their life\u2019, a heavy price to ask for the truth.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou may simply believe that Dearion was born cold-hearted
    and stone-faced, unable to feel emotion for the commonfolk he so blatantly takes
    advantage of.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DBut the truth is\u2026 Dearion simply forgot who he was.
    Everyone did. As the God of Memory, I simply cannot allow that to be the case.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI needed to contact you regarding this. I needed a person
    such as yourself. You are blind to this false truth, in a literal sense. You
    cannot see the lies the lack of memories of history are causing, the horrible
    consequence that follow the most grave forgetfulness.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI beg of you. You are the only hope of this kingdom. I
    have forseen your success. You will walk out in a few minutes. A fire will start
    soon enough in a nearby house: the work of anarchic arsonistst, spitting in the
    face of Emperor Dearion\u2014 this I have forseen.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DSo, use this opportunity. Slip in the allyways of the city
    and reach the imperial palace. Once you are there, search for the back of the
    palace. No guards will be there on account of the fire. Before the door, feel
    your hand against the wall, until the wall no longer feels real. There, speak
    the word \u201CCOGITUS\u201D.</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou will need to remember the history of this kingdom.
    This task is much to bear, that I know. However, you must not falter. Consider
    access to the Secret Halls my first test to you.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI will speak to you when you arrive there. Please, Keeper.\u201C</color>"
  - "Before you can respond to the voice, or inquire about everything that\u2019s
    been said\u2026 you feel warmth coming over your side."
  - "People are starting to panic outside. A number of guards are rapidly approaching,
    and sounds of battle seem to have begun\u2026 is this\u2026 the fire? The anarchists?
    Has the voice\u2026 told the truth?"
  - "Only one way to find out\u2026"
  - "You are tired. You were probably hallucinating! That conversation never even
    happened\u2026 you may as well just sleep over it! After all, the fire is making
    your bed <i> sooooo cozy </i>\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI\u2026 beg of you\u2026 save\u2026 this kingdom. You cannot
    fall asleep now. Not like\u2026 <i>HER</i>\u2026 again\u2026\u201D </color>"
  - Well, so much for it being an hallucination. You can still hear the voice in
    your head.
  - You grumble and pout. You would rather be sleeping but you guess you can do a
    little effort to save the Kingdom. The Voice owes you one, however.
  - You hastily find clothing and a cloak to mask your form. As the battle rages
    on outside, you slip, to your knowledege unnoticed or at the very least disregarded
    by the agents of the conflict outside.
  - "Even without sight, you know the road to the Imperial Palace all to well. You
    stop to occasionally hear the guards make their way towards the fray. You hear
    the city being turned inside out by the populace. This isn\u2019t a fire\u2026
    this is a true revolution."
  - "You fear that if the voice lied to you\u2026 there will be no populace left
    in this kingdom after tonight. Only foolish revolutionaries or obidient slaves
    to Emperor Dearion. "
  - Making your way to the palace, you perk your ears to spot any guards that may
    still be lurking outside the place. Fortunately for you, the entrance is silent.
  - "Like a shadow, you guide yourself with the side of the wall, moving as fast
    as a stealthy approach allows you to, reaching the back of the palace after a
    few minutes: the curvature of the wall ended, and once again a flat surface meets
    your palm\u2014 you remembered the Imperial Palace being oval in shape from the
    time when you could still see!"
  - "Has\u2026 your memory improved somewhat? Wait\u2026 memory?"
  - "As your hand moves alongside the wall, it suddenly gives way to nothing. Your
    arm slides inside a cavity, almost perfectly shaped to fit your arm and an open
    palm at its end. This sudden movement prompts a soft humming from the wall\u2026"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201CPLEASE, ACCESS THE MAGILOCK BY SPEAKING THE
    SECRET PASSCODE. \u201D </color></mspace>"
  - "Oh, rats. You were supposed to remember that word the Voice told you! What\u2026
    what was it again?"
  - "The gate hums back: <mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\"INCORRECT PASSCODE. \u201D
    </color></mspace>"
  - "No\u2026 that wasn\u2019t it\u2026. It was\u2026 something like\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DCO\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026GIT\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026US\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "The gate hums back: <mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\"CORRECT PASSCODE. \u201D
    </color></mspace>"
  - "Without any warning, you feel a sudden, magical force drag you towards the wall.
    You brace for impact, expecting it to be hard as\u2026 well\u2026 wall usually
    is. Instead, the bricks have turned to the consistency of gelatine, bouncing
    and shifting to your body being pulled in ever deeper."
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou have made it! You have made it\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DNow, let the walls carry you to the forgotten, silent halls
    of this castle. Let the events of the past enter your mind.\u201D</color>"
  - "Crushed within these walls, your breath becomes more unsteady\u2026 it becomes
    harder and harder to hold on\u2026 Until you lose conciousness."
