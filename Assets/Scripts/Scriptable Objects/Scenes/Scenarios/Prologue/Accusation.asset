  - "This story is \u2013 like many others \u2013 something I heard once in a lullaby.
    A fairy tale misremembered and presented to you, Player. After reciving answers
    to all questions, life becomes predictable, steady and, the most heinous crime
    of all\u2014 boring. Let this fantasy tale take you again \u2013 as they took
    you before \u2013 into the realm of child-like wonder and amazement, of the impossible
    becoming possible\u2014 a realm of gods, demons, bygone kings of ancient lands
    and mystical artifacts of old."
  - "Let the sounds of a lonely, rainy winter evening transport you into an old cabin,
    homely and warm. If you extend your ear enough, you may hear the crackling of
    fire in the stone hearth, the whittling of wood under your careful heads\u2014
    feel the roughness of the pine\u2019s bark, the pressure of the wood against
    the rough edge of the blade, the smoothness of your work."
  - "You have never been able to see, but you still took pride in it. There is not
    much the blind can do around here\u2014 narrow-minded folk think of them as nothing
    more than beggers, nuisances\u2026 but you have proved those people wrong, time
    and time again. Your craft as fine as your cooking."
  - "You hear the light simmering of the beginnings of a soup on the fire\u2014 the
    awaited chorus to the backdrop of rain lightly tip-toeing over the roof of your
    cabin. You begin to smell the light, fragrant aroma of stewed vegetables and
    the fresh wild-mushroom broth that accompanies them, nutty and rich. Your nose
    is particularly keen this evening \u2013 blame it on the wet weather \u2013 and
    you manage to pick up the light petrichor of the ground next to your cabin."
  - "What was once the shed of a hunter who lived in town became your home after
    you gathered enough coin and, despite the appearances that were meaninglessly
    described to you, it served its job, proudly and with gusto. It never was anything
    big, but you didn\u2019t mind. It was cozy, it was warm, it was secure: it was
    home."
  - "Well\u2026 at least you did think it was secure."
  - 'Your ears pick up another sound. Distant, but still faintly audible. You fatigue
    to discern it from the light, drizzling rain but as it moves closer, it becomes
    more evident: horse hooves, clampering down the now-muddy road of your village.'
  - "You aren\u2019t initially concerned by the sound\u2014 plenty of horses have
    passed around this small frontier town and these surely aren\u2019t the first
    nor the last. However, as the sound of galloping becomes closer \u2013 and slower
    \u2013 you begin to wonder if these people have come for you."
  - Before your mind even thinks of the possibilities, a screeching voice interrupts
    your thinking.
  - Taken from your home in a cold winter evening to be judged in front of the emperor
    for high treason. None of this makes sense. But you are convinced the good Emperor
    and His men will see that they must have made a mistake. There is no way someone
    like you would be convicted for treason. Treason of all things!
  - "These thoughts keep you up during the various nights that make your travel towards
    the Capital. You barely exchange words with the agent, he\u2019s a secretive
    and reclusive person and no conversation prolongs further than the one you had
    during your arrest. He refuses to speak of your situation but at least he was
    kind enough to give you his name\u2014 Viktor."
  - 'After a week of travel, you and your captor finally reach the gates of the Capital:
    the prisoner ready for his long awaited judgement.'
