    <b>Shining Blades</b>'
  - "You feel nauseated and disoriented. The first sensation that hits you is the
    cold stone floor\u2019s gelid contact. Your nostrils are filled with dust, as
    is everything around you. As you slowly get up, you feel a thick layer of dust
    everywhere on the floor. Wherever you are, no-other person has been in a long
    time."
  - You steadily get up, a sense of vertigo almost pushing you back down. With the
    help of your hands, you take a few minutes to restabilize yourself.
  - 'Currently, nothing is at hand: no points of reference for you, but the floor.
    Istinctually, you take short steps forwards, hands in front of yourself attempting
    to find a surface to use as a guide.'
  - "After a dozen or so steps, your hand meet something that feels slighly rugged.
    As you keep touching in an attempt to discern what it is, your hand occasionally
    meets direct, gravely stone; occasionally, a chip of material; more often than
    not, surface bumps of sometipe\u2014 for sure it is not braile, but, using your
    imagination, you can figure this is some form of mosaic, ruined by the passage
    of time."
  - "Definetly, this is a mosaic of sorts: If you spend some time studying over this\u2026
    you may actually understand what it represents. You decide that for now this
    is the best course of action."
  - "Investigating the mosaic takes you some time, but after accurately placing your
    hands over the various figures you can discern something\u2026"
  - Represented on the mural are a number of individuals, wiedling weapons, all around.
    Some of the ones in the center are fighting given the various connections you
    feel between figures.
  - You wager this is some sort of war.
  - Further in your exploration, you feel something on the higher parts of the mosaic.
    It is a plaque of some sort.
  - You decide that the plaque may provide you with further information on whatever
    you have currently in front of you.
  - 'While it is not written in braile, you do know the shapes and forms of the letters
    of the alphabet. With some patience and time, you painstainkingly read the entire
    plaque:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CThe Battle of Shining Blades: Here was the
    kingdom\u2019s indipendence gained, here were the kingdom\u2019s most valuable
    lives lost: thank them for their sacrifice and you may progress further.\u201D
    </mspace></color>"
  - "You stop and think for a second\u2026 there\u2019s something wrong with this
    statement\u2026"
  - "The voice of Ammon enters your head once more. <color=#00e64d>\u201CTwo individuals
    gave their life at Shining Blades. Two individuals that the Emperor grew attached
    to, those that, more than war-comrades were life-long friends. The Emperor, much
    like Shining Blades itself, no longer remembers them and their crypt lies unused
    and forgotten.\u201D</color>"
  - "The voice of Ammon enters your head once more. <color=#00e64d>\u201CThis land
    was once under the tyrannical rule of a Warlord called Zung of the Early Dawn.
    This is something Dearion still belives but has not been the case for a long
    time. He longingly looks into the distance, hoping to spot an army that has already
    been here. Sharpening blades for a battle already fought\u2026 and already won.\u201D
    </color>"
  - "The voice of Ammon enters your head once more. <color=#00e64d>\u201CThe narrow
    crevasse that separates the valley where this kingdom is hidden to the rest of
    the world is known as Shining Blades. This much you knew. However, you all have
    forgotten of the bloody war waged there\u2026 of the smashing victory\u2026 and
    the crushing losses of Emperor Dearion\u2019s friends.\u201D</color>"
  - "The voice of Ammon enters your head once more. <color=#00e64d>\u201CDuring the
    now forgotten battle, two people gave their life to save Dearion. Two people
    and the items that prove their connection to Dearion, which now lay forgotten
    in this tomb\u2026 Two people that didn\u2019t deserve to be forgotten.\u201D</color>"
  - The words of Ammon seem particularly sad. It is something that you can feel is
    hurting him to say.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201CIn a sense, I do. As the God of Memory, I know about everything
    that transpired and will transpire. I know of what truly happened here\u2026
    and why it was forgotten.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201CIt is none of your fault. You weren\u2019t there to prevent
    it, you weren\u2019t there to forget it\u2026 but I was.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201CYes. Let\u2019s. This matches with my plans.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d> \u201CI suggest you spend as little time as possible just talking
    to me. It would be better for you to understand by way of proof\u2014 I know
    there is little trust in the words of an Outlawed God, so I\u2019d rather you
    see for yourself. Your time in here is short\u2026 and there is much to remember.
    Do not worry\u2026 you will have the occasion to tread back on these conversations\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - You shake your head confused. You have no idea what these words mean.
  - 'You now stand in front of the wall, ready to make your choices. You start with
    the wall in front of you, examining the edges of the mosaic. '
  - "Further alongside the wall, you feel two slits\u2026 do you want to place your
    hands in them?"
  - You do not place your hands on the slits. Instead, you turn to look further inside
    the room.
  - Alongside which wall do you want to move?
  - Skirting alongside the Left wall, you now gain a glimpse of the structure of
    the room as the wall curves inwards. Some sort of wide circular room.
  - It takes you a good minute or two to reach anything of note. Occasionally, your
    hands touch barricated windows, your feet hit rocky pebbles that were once part
    of the wall, your face and hair gets tangled with old cobwebs long abandoned
    by their little inhabitants.
  - "The air around the place feels as heavy and as clogged and old as everything
    else in here. Your mouth inhales a good dose of collected dust scattered around
    in the environment with every step\u2014 first signs of activity in a long, long
    time."
  - Alongside the left wall, your hand finally moves inside a new alcove. Considerably
    smaller than the large mosaic that was to your now-right, the one in front of
    you now best extends by a few feet both horizontally and vertically.
  - "Once again, by the feel of the material of this, you can guess this is another
    mosaic. Your hand quickly scans for features once again. It appreas to be a single
    large figure, an individual of some sort. It is striking a proud pose, holding
    something in hand\u2014 short and thing."
  - A plaque stands above the mosaic. Once again, you take some time to spell out
    its contents.
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201C<b><i>188</b></i>. Shrine of <b><i>Junia</i></b>,
    Court Wizard. She brought magic as both a wizard and a true friend. Here she
    lies buried with her <b><i>Wand of the War Mage</b></i>.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DJunia was a genius. Extremely young and extremely talented
    as a mage. So much so that Emperor Dearion gave her the charge of Captain of
    the 16th Regiment at Shining Blades\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DJunia\u2019s most prized possession was the <b><i>Wand
    of the War Mage.</b></i> It was gifted to her by Dearion himself when she became
    the Court Wizard at only 15. While it wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary,
    the Wand carries emotional attachment for both Junia and Dearion\u2026 or at
    least, it did.</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DTruthfully, Junia never trained as a Wizard. Just a magically
    inclined girl with a lot of innate talent and a very, very patient and clement
    king. Emperor Dearion caught her stealing from his personal room when she was
    only <b><i>12</i></b>. Instead of punishing her, he applauded her abilities and
    asked her if she wanted to train under him.</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>The Emperor doesn\u2019t remember her, but Junia\u2019s spirit
    still does remember her friend and mentor. Emperor Dearion was the father Junia
    never had, the friend that never judged her for who she was, for her talent and
    for her age.</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>Junia never survived Shining Blades. Her regiment decided as
    a bold manouver to distract the enemy cavalry to allow for further retreat. A
    strategic move that resulted in a painful trade: The 16th Regiment\u2019s life
    in exchange for a smashing victory.</color>"
  - <color=#00e64d>When counting casualties, Junia ended up being the <b><i>188th</b></i>.
    This is the reason why that number is engraved in front of her name. Emperor
    Dearion cried for a day straight when he received the news of her demise.</color>
  - "<color=#00e64d>I realize it is weird for me to spin such a tale of Dearion,
    the man who hunts me down so vehemently\u2026 but I\u2019m impratial to the matters
    of man and their strife. He was a good men\u2026 Can men simply forget who they
    are? Are they so reliant on memory and the events that transpire to shape them?</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>I\u2019m\u2026 sorry for my rambling. You best get back. </color>"
  - You move back towards the center of the room.
  - You decide to turn your attention to the Right of this room. Taking light steps,
    you start hearing the faint drizzling of water. A small puddle has formed from
    a leak in the brickwork. Some form of underground river or spring must be somewhere
    nearby, hastily walled over by whoever worked on this Shrine.
  - The pavement, much like the rest of this room, has barely stood the test of time,
    weathered by the small puddle worming its way around the brickwork. You feel
    the slippery cobbles barely fit for walking underneath your shoes.
  - "The rest of the wall\u2019s conditions aren\u2019t much nicer. You feel as if
    every brick you place your hand on is going to fall, like a precarious tree trunk
    ready to fall over at any strike. You exercise particular caution when moving
    around here, at it takes you slightly longer than expected."
  - "Alongside the right wall, your hand meets a sudden emptiness: an alcove of some
    sort, possibly another mosaic of some sort\u2014 albeit much smaller than the
    one on the central wall."
  - Your guess proves correct when your hand moves over the wall contained in this
    small alcove. A mosaic of a large figure, striking an heroic pose with weapon
    high in the sky and a large object in his left hand.
  - A plaque stands above this mosaic. You take some time to read its contents.
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201C<b><i>392</i></b>. Shrine of <b><i>Barristan</i></b>,
    Right Hand of the Emperor. His ingenious battle cunning and the power of his
    <b><i>Shield of Princely Protection</b></i> were only second to his thunderous
    laughter and jovial spirit.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D<b><i>Barristan</b></i> was a man like no other. Emperor
    Daerion knew him ever since he rose from small nobility into a figure of relevance
    in the kingdom. Back then, he was a simple mercenary\u2014 scrounging coins in
    exchange for his brilliant tactics.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIn time they both became more and more attached to one
    another. From a soldier of fortune and his master to true friends. Both have
    taken many blades and arrows for one another, in both a literal and metaphorical
    sense. This is why Barristan prized his <b><i>Shield of Princely Protection.
    </b></i>\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DSurprisingly enough, the Shield wasn\u2019t gifted by Dearion.
    It was won over a game of cards. Barristan remembers that day well, he won with
    a smashing <b><i>61 </b></i>points\u2026 against Dearion\u2019s 59.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DOf course, Barristan was a bit too drunk to realize the
    Emperor lost intentionally\u2026 it may have stopped his bragging about it if
    he had known. But the Emperor didn\u2019t seem to mind letting his friend tell
    a tall-tale of a card game narrated with such emphasis that makes fighting a
    dragon look like a regular Tuesday afternoon.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAll his joy and cunning did not stop the arrows that killed
    him at Shining Blades, however.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIn the battle, Barristan was the <b><i>392nd</b></i> and
    last casualty of the battle. As the enemy archers fired their last volley before
    routing away from the battlefield, Barristan valiantly stood in front of the
    arrows that would have killed the Emperor\u2026 and lost his life in the process.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion has forgotten about this, of course. So has everyone
    else. Such noble sacrifice, a fate diverted\u2026 what for? If no-one rememembers
    your name have you even existed in the first place? Quell these questions in
    me and remember Barristan\u2019s name, please: so that his sacrifice may have
    not been in vain. You best go back and search more clues.\u201D</color>"
  - You move back towards the center of the room.
  - Two slits stand in front of you. You initally place your hand inside the one
    to your left
  - 'Once again, the slit feels just the right size for an arm to fit through. With
    a hum, the wall responds:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CMy Emperor, have you come to honor the dead?
    You are the only one that may proceed.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CProve to me you are Dearion. Speak aloud
    this passcode: The Initial of the Court Wizard. The number associated with her
    death. The initial of her weapon of choice. And the years she had when you first
    met her. (All letters need to be Uppercase!)\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "The gate hums back:<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CIncorrect Passcode.\u201D
    </color></mspace>"
  - You remove your hand from the slit and look at the wall again.
  - "The gate hums: <mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CCorrect Passcode. Please,
    unlock the next one to progress.\u201D </mspace></color >"
  - 'You insert your hand on the right slit, which fits your arm perfectly. With
    a hum the wall responds:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CMy Emperor, have you come to honor the dead?
    You are the only one that may proceed.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CProve to me you are Dearion. Speak aloud
    this passcode: The Initial of your Right Hand. The number associated with his
    death. The initial of his Prized Shield. And the points he got when he won it
    from you. (All letters need to be Uppercase!)\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "The gate hums back:<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CIncorrect Passcode.\u201D
    </color></mspace>"
  - You remove your hands from the slits and look at the wall again.
  - "The gate hums: <mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201CCorrect Passcode. Welcome
    to the Hall of Memories, Emperor Dearion. The Horn of Ammon awaits you.\u201D</mspace></color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI knew I made the right choice. You are remembering the
    life and death of the people closest to Dearion, for he has forgotten.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DLet me show you why he has and... my involvement in all
    of this.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI must warn you. I cannot help your reaction over the discoveries
    you will make. I can only hope you keep your mind focused and your heart steady.\u201D</color>"
