  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAfter all this time\u2026 there is a chance to right my
    wrongs.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThank you for this.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026 there is but one step left. Facing Dearion.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D While the memories are now back in the horn\u2026 they
    are not with Dearion. Not yet. You need to find an occasion to talk to him and
    return these memories to him.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D But there is a problem.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DA BIG Problem.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWe can\u2019t simply use the Horn.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI\u2019m afraid that reciving back all of those painful
    memories will be a shock for Dearion. If he recieves them all at once, with no
    chance to process them or make them have logical sense\u2026 Dearion\u2019s sanity
    may forever be twisted.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWe will need to give him the information slowly\u2026 but
    there will be no chance to do so without Dearion noticing. </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion doesn\u2019t trust Maurice and he\u2019ll be wary
    of any word he says, so he cannot be the person to tell him the truth. So I have
    a plan, but you may not like it.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou need to receive audience with the King himself.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAdvancing towards him in good terms will be nigh impossible
    right now\u2014 as the revolution rages, so does Dearion\u2019s hatred for his
    enemies. Right now he needs a political distraction\u2026 something to pin the
    blame on.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAn Ammon worshipper, perhaps? Or\u2026 better yet, Ammon\u2019s
    Keeper?\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYes, I do. I mean giving yourself up to Dearion and getting
    your audience not as a honoured guest\u2026 but as a prisoner on trial.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou will need to make a case for yourself. If Dearion is
    truly the person he is, deep down, he will listen. You just need his attention
    and your memory, as long as the Horn is somewhat close to Dearion, it will do
    the rest.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion can\u2019t remember anything unless he willingly
    choses to do so. To do that, you will need to help him recall the events of his
    life. As he ponders about everything, he will slowly extract the memories from
    the Horn himself.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DSlowly, calmly... at his own pace. Dearion\u2019s disposition
    may visibly change during the Trial but you must continue until everything is
    remembered and no stone in Dearion\u2019s mind is left unturned.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAs for the consequences of our actions\u2026 we will have
    to improvise.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI\u2019m afraid not. We can\u2019t afford to wait any longer
    than tonight. Dearion\u2019s temperment may become too jaded to even allow for
    simple discourse by then.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DBut this also means that if you can\u2019t make Dearion
    recall his past...<i> YOU WILL DIE. </i>\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThis is the only way.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DKeeper please! You must understand that this is the only
    hope we have to set things right, we can\u2019t give up now!\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIf it\u2019s not tonight, it\u2019s <b><i>NEVER</i></b>.
    Are you truly unwilling to change Dearion\u2019s mind? After everything we have
    been through?\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThank you for reconsidering.\u201C</color>"
  - Player, is this truly your final choice? (You will get a unique Epilogue and
    ending, but miss the True Ending of the game).
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI\u2026 have vowed to not make the same mistake again.
    I will not impose my will over you. Mortals have to make their own choices.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou have to escape the Palace, correct? You need only to
    buy enough time\u2026 this I have forseen. Revolutionaries will soon be at the
    doors and the guards won\u2019t hold them back for long. Get dragged to Dearion\u2019s
    chamber and use the time he gives you to spin a long story. Buy yourself enough
    time to wait for your saviours to arrive.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DTake a horse... flee the palace. Flee the Cruel Kingdom
    and what it could have been. I just ask that you leave the Horn of Ammon to Maurice.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThank you.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI supposed I\u2019m not owed any gratitude.\u201C</color>"
  - Exploring around a room, you find the place where supposedly stairs used to be,
    covered in boards. A few swift kicks allow you to break through towards the exit
    from this accursed mausoleum.
  - "Following the advice of Ammon, you get captured by the guards. When prompted
    to speak, you start spinning a tall tale\u2026 buying yourself enough time to
    let the court be dismissed. Your about to be executed on the spot when the revolutionaires
    break down the doors of the Throne room."
  - "The battle is fierce and brutal, but fairly swift. Amidst the chaos and carnage,
    you find a way to grab the guard\u2019s keys, unlock your manacles and bolt out
    of the palace. Heading for the stables, you can find a horse in well enough conditions."
  - You flee. You run out of the walls of the city into the great unknown, no destination
    able to be seen, no track to follow, no other option but to wander. But at the
    very least you are free.
  - "Some nights, nightmares about the event that occurred within the palace haunt
    your dreams\u2014 a cackling mad laughter, walls that swallow you whole, the
    fear of never waking up again\u2026 but none of it matters anymore. You hear
    in passing news that the revolution of the Kingdom of Sheon has been crushed
    by an opposing rival lord who has siezed control of the Palace and the Imperial
    City."
  - "Slowly, but surely, even the nightmares subside. You have proven that gods cannot
    meddle with men undisturbed. There is no other concern but survival: to die in
    the attempt of heroism is a tale only for books or games and the grim reality
    of the situation says that men have to look out for themselves. Those who are
    heroic are killed\u2014 such was Shining Blades. Those who attempt sacrifice
    get punished\u2014 such is the tale of the late King Dearion."
  - "A tale only you know\u2026 and even then, over time, come to forget. One last
    time, you give it thought\u2026 what could it have been? What consequences have
    your actions had? Could you have saved the Kingdom?"
  - "\u2026 the real question is \u2018Does it matter anymore\u2019?"
  - You think not.
  - ...
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DVery well. We don\u2019t have much time. Let\u2019s find
    a way out of here first.\u201C</color>"
  - Knocking over the walls, you find that some planks ring hollow. They have nothing
    behind them! It takes you some time, but you manage to break them apart with
    a  few kicks. Inside this small exit, you feel with your hands a spiral staircase
    that leads straight up.
  - Taking the staircase, you walk for a considerable amount of time, until it suddenly
    ends. You appear in a closed off room as your hands tell you. Stumbling towards
    some form of exit, you realize one brick is looser than the other. Pushing it
    down causes a heavy shift in the wall, the vibrations of which you can feel with
    your own hands.
  - "You walk into the silent hallways of the Palace for a while, attempting to find
    anyone to take you to the throne room\u2026 but the Silent Hallways are called
    so for a reason."
  - "\u2026"
  - "You feel lost\u2026 when suddenly!"
  - A figure ambushes you from behind!
  - Startled you turn around, only to hear the familiar voice of the Jester.
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201COh Keeper! You are here! Finally! Ammon warned me about
    his plans! He is a wise God indeed\u2026 wise and cunning!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CWell, it seems you need to be caught\u2026 and some help
    telling a story I see! Well, well, well!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CWorry not Keeper! I can arrange both for you, lickety-split!
    I\u2019ll go back to the Throne Room and say to them that I have found not any
    heretic, but one that SPEAKS to Ammon! But\u2026 there is a small problem\u2026\u201D
    </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CYou will probably be shaken down for your possessions
    when they find you. But I have thought of this too! Please, Keeper, let me have
    the Horn of Ammon! I shall give it to you when the timing is more fortuitus!\u201D
    </color>"
  - You give to Maurice the Horn of Ammon for temporary safekeeping.
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CVery well! It\u2019s time for our little play to start!
    I can\u2019t believe this! The Keeper has arrived on this dreary night, spoken
    with Ammon, fixed the Horn and is about to save the Kingdom! How exciting! What
    honor to be able to set up this act with them!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CAhah! I can\u2019t wait! I\u2019ll hurry as fast as I
    can!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201COf course, of course! This is no moment for pleasantries!
    I\u2019ll hurry as fast as I can!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CWe are blessed by Ammon, even in death our names will
    be forever rememembered! Good luck and remember to act the part!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CAHAH! Even to the end the Keeper proves to be the gift
    that keeps on giving! I may have some competition as professional funnyman! I\u2019ll
    get the guards, you stay here, alright?\u201D </color>"

  - What!?
  - Why not?
  - And how would I do that?
  - You don't mean...
  - My memory?
  - There is no Plan B?
  - Okay.
  - No way!
