  - You were wandering the halls of the Imperial Palace, hoping to receive audience
    with the Emperor himself. Unfortunately enough, your prayers have been answered.
  - A guards spots you before you notice its presence. With a shout, many more are
    called to your position. You make no attempt to resist, in case your arrest turns
    into your death.
  - One by one, a number of guards subdue you and then forcibly start moving you.
    Once again, you pose no resistance to them.
  - ...
  - But you already knew this, did you not?
  - "Let\u2019s skip to the good part\u2026"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CWell\u2026 Begin to tell your story. Possibly from the

    meeting Elodie. \u201C</color>"
  - You say to Dearion that the story begins a bit further back than that.

    begin?\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDid you already forget? This is not where Elodie met Dearion!\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou have to focus! This is no joke! The next time you spell
    out a wrong answer it may be FATAL!\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CA.. gala? Like, a ball of sorts? What relevance does it
    have with you? Are you hoping to dance to save your life? It would you do more

  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CAt last, I chose to save my people over my personal plight
    and pain. Even as I am ailing right now, I cannot help to think what the people
    will be like upon receiving these news. Will they still hate me? Will they be
    accepting?\u201C </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI welcome their choice above all others\u2026 While my
    heart\u2026 aches so for what fate had in store for the people next to me\u2026
    I cannot wallow in what once was forever. I need to look forward into the future.
    For the good of my people.\u201C </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CGuards\u2026 free the Stranger from his bindings.\u201C
    </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201C\u2026 and let him go, not only as a free men, but as an
    honoured guest of this palace. Open up the Silent Halls back again. Restore the
    Mausoleum to Memories there-in\u2026 I will personally hire every alchemist and
    wizard this side of the World in hope of finding a cure for Elodie.\u201C </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI want to see her back again\u2026 after all I made a promise
    to her. However I cannot let it distract me from my rule. My people need me and
    I need to be there for them. However I do wish some time to reflect upon this.
    Possibly now\u2026 Maurice, you remember what happened too, do you not?\u201C
    </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CI most certainly do, Dearion my Dear-ion!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CEheh\u2026 I missed these types of jokes. Let us excuse
    us for a moment and once more toast to the fallen\u2026 never forgetting them
    again but looking at our future.\u201C </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> \u201CWhy only me and you, Dearion? This is an occasion worthy
    of a GRAND celebration!\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CSure... why not? Guards, call upon all workers of the castle:
    there is a banquet to be held!\u201C </color>"
  - "With quick step, the various guards that once held you in chains free you and
    immediately walk around the castle, attempting to gather any and all workers
    they can. The situation outside seems to have calmed fast\u2014 as the Emperor\u2019s
    memories came to him, so did the populace who dropped the weapons and started
    talking about what was happening. Luckly enough, only a few people got injured
    and none died."
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI have but one question for you, Stranger\u2026 do you
    wish to remain for the celebrations? Or do you wish to return home?\u201C </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CVery well then! I\u2019m sure there are some to whom you
    also want to pay respect! Let us then discuss of what once was to bolster our
    future together!\u201C </color>"
  - "<color=#cc0000>\u201CI understand well, you must be exhausted. The celebrations
    will last for a few days, so you may come and go as you please. After all, you
    are now an estimed guest of the Palace!\u201C </color>"
  - "The next few days, a grand banquet is held. The people, once rageful and spiteful
    towards Dearion have warmed up to him once more. The king returned his auspicious
    self\u2026 if not improving. You do not know if Dearion\u2019s attempts at bringing
    back Elodie will succeed or not\u2026 but you know Dearion will not falter no
    matter what. Wallowing in the past is a trap that Dearion won\u2019t fall into
    again. Maurice has gained new-found respect from the populace, being hailed as
    a saivor just as much as yourself\u2026after all you have to admit that without
    his help, none of this would have happened."
  - "As for you\u2026 your story is yours to write and to live. Whichever countries
    you will visit, battles you\u2019ll fight and days you\u2019ll survive are yet
    to be seen\u2026 but all of them will be lived with the knowledge that you\u2019ll
    look back at those moments and have a new lesson to learn, a new story to tell,
    a bad day you\u2019ll have survived\u2026 all of those memories make a part of
    who you are. Don\u2019t let your future be defined by your past, but let its
    lessons reveal the path you want to follow."
  - "If this story is to be treated as a fable\u2026 then I want that to be its moral."
