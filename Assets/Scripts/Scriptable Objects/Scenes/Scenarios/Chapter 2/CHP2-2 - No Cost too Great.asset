    <b>Horn of Ammon</b>'
  - Your current objective is to open the case that contains the shards of the Horn
    of Ammon. It would be best to start examining that.
  - 'Placing your hands on the stone pedistal, you notice a cavity you missed before.
    Slinding your hand inside, the pedistal reacts:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201DPronounce the two passcodes to open the case.
    The first one low to the ground\u2014 as low as Ammon\u2019s vile intentions.
    The second one high up in this room, touching the sky\u2014 where Ammon hides
    from the retribution \u201D</mspace></color>"
  - "It\u2019s clear that you must find a code somewhere low and somewhere high\u2026
    what would you like to do?"
  - You get down on all fours, attempting to scrounge any ounce of information from
    the floor.
  - "Exploring this large, hexagonal room takes you some time, especially as you
    need to scour every surface for what could be even close to a letter or symbol\u2014
    praying every deity you know that they aren\u2019t simply written down."
  - "To your relif, circling around the room seems to be an inscryption cast in some
    cold, metal with a vague smell of iron\u2014 pig iron or weak steel of sorts
    you wager."
  - "Especially time consuming is the actual reading process, as the letters are
    scattered and cleverly hidden from being felt with one\u2019s feet by being at
    level with the rest of the flooring."
  - 'After some time, you get the entire writing. It reads the following:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201DThis is the tomb of the memories of Emperor
    Dearion. The sacrifices the people around him did. The venerations to the Gods.
    The Grieving Loss he still suffers from to this day.\u201D </mspace></color >"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201DThe first room is dedicated to  the heroes
    of Shining Blade\u2014 the crushing battle of the year 1340 of the new Age and
    where Dearion\u2019s dearest gave their life for victory\u201D.</mspace> </color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201Dthe <i>Second</i> room is Dedicated to the
    Horn of Ammon, a dedication to the unknown god of memory\u201D</color> </mspace>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201DThe Last Room is the resting place of Elodie,
    his wife. She has been sleeping there ever since she turned 35.</color>"
  - You make a mental note of everything spelled on the ground and proceed to examine
    the rest of the room.
  - You begin your careful examination of the walls. Maybe additional clues related
    to this room or the case may be written alongside them.
  - You spend some time to comb through them as thoroughly as possible, making sure
    that not a single inch of wall is unturned.
  - "Unfortunately enough\u2026 you find nothing of relevance. No clues that you
    can pick up by touch or smell is immediately available to you."
  - "However\u2026 there may be still a way to examine the walls."
  - "That\u2019s it for the walls on your end\u2026"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DOhh, Keeper! How may I be of service to you?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DOf course! There may be something interesting along the
    walls\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DMh\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DMhhhhhh\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DMhhhhhhhhh... Oh!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThere is a small excerpt on the wall, I\u2019ll read it
    for you!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DHere lie the spoils of Ammon, profane god of Memory. May
    his actions be forever codemned. Let this display be proof that men do not need
    Gods to mess with their minds.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThe Gods want nothing but pain from us mortals\u2014 when
    they come knocking it\u2019s never to bring gifts, only to remind us never to
    accept them.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThe malignant God has set a seed of pain in Dearion's heart
    to weaken him and break his will.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DAs the last note of a discordant song, Ammon left everyone
    around him cursed and broken, this is why... this is why...\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DArgh! Frustrating. I can\u2019t read any further, it gets
    way too dark after that. Sorry about it.\u201D</color>"
  - You thank the Jester and resume your investigation.
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DEhm\u2026 Keeper\u2026 I find it a bit hard to do that
    given the steep drop between you and me. It looks to be roughly 50 feet. I can
    barely see your form, much less the ground from here! Unless\u2026 was that a
    joke?\u201D</color>"
  - "\u2026 Well, it was worth a shot."
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DMh? Oh, of course! Let\u2019s see here\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DOn the ceiling there\u2019s a small poem. I\u2019ll read
    it aloud for you!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DAmmon: the Cruel Joke\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DA thousand, five-hundred and four curses to you.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201Dyour Wicked Ways are Done.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI can\u2019t say I blame Dearion for his reaction, even
    if it hurts me personally. Curses of such type are commonplace for mortals with
    anger against the gods\u2026 I just never figured I\u2019d see one written in
    my name.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DOh, yeah! This may be important to mention but the case
    of the sentences was a bit off.\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DOf course, I attempted to portray the letter\u2019s case
    as best as I could in my beautiful speech! Child\u2019s play for one such proficent
    in the use of the word, you see\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DYou never know if you may need it somehow\u2026 Eheheheheh\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - You thank the Jester and resume your investigation.
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DI\u2019m humbled, truly! What do you want to hear from
    little ol\u2019 me?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DAmmon is the most magnificent of gods, obiviously! His
    power of memory is beyond compare!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DGods can grow crops, or smite fools with holy light\u2026
    but how many of them will exist when time passes by? How many will be truly remembered?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DNo matter what\u2026 Ammon remains. Truly, if there was
    a god to worship, why wouldn\u2019t you follow the truly immortal one?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DI used to merely worship Ammon, but you could say I\u2019m
    a bit of a zealot. After all, hearing your god\u2019s voice does wonders to stimulate
    one\u2019s belief!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DIt happened so suddenly! I was flabbergasted! The Great
    Ammon speaking to a low one such as I! Mearly a clown!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DI no longer remember when Ammon stopped talking to me\u2026
    but it feels as if an eternity has passed\u2026 what I would I give to hear his
    smooth whispering again!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI could no longer contact Maurice after Dearion destroyed
    the horn. I can no longer contact anyone in the kingdom. Anyone but you.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI\u2019m sorry you had to be caught in this crossfire,
    but Maurice has also been subjected to this false truth, like everyone else in
    the kingdom. As long as they are a witness of it, I cannot enter their mind.
    The God of Memory cannot gain access to what has not happened.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DSuch are the limitations of my power. I can create a boulder
    heavy enough for me to be unable to lift it. That was the use of the Horn.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWith the horn still intact, anyone who used it would be
    able to regain their memories so even if I made a mess Dearion could still return
    the way he was... but Dearion broke it.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI waited patiently until the day I was able to contact
    him or Maurice again\u2026 but that day never came. Until I found you, that is.
    Your blindness confirmed to me my suspicions: Dearion wasn\u2019t content with
    this arrangement, he just broke the Horn.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI put too much faith in Dearion's ability to restore this
    situation, and he put too much faith in my ability to heal his ailing heart.
    Our crime wasn\u2019t maliciousness, it was trust.\u201D</color>"
  - "Well, that\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThere isn\u2019t much to tell about myself. My name is
    Maurice Delaroe, entratainer and professional funnyman.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DBut truthfully I\u2019m also the advisor to the king. Not
    having a central figure as one makes the king appear more competent and capable\u2026
    if only the dolts of the Imperial Court knew! Ah, they\u2019d be the fools then!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DI\u2019ve worked in the Imperial Court for a while now.
    Dearion trusts me my judgement a lot, but they can\u2019t let everyone know he
    takes advice on important matters from a clown.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThat would shatter his reputation as a ruler. But we both
    found a workaround!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DEach jab and quip disguises suggestions and mysteries!
    Pretty exciting wordcraft, don\u2019t you think?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201CHm\u2026 I\u2019d thought you\u2019d me more excited about
    it. Oh well.\u201D</color>"
  - "Well, that\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DYou\u2019re a tough crowd, lemme tell you that much. But
    I like it\u2026 keeps me sharp. Ahahah\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "Well, that\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DBrilliant! Not only you are the Keeper but you also are
    a jokester! This truly is a blessed day!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\"<size=150%>Ahah<size=125%>ahh<size=100%>ahah<size=75%>ahah<size=50%>ahah<size=25%>ahah<size=12%>aha\u2026<size=100%>\"</color>"
  - "Well, that\u2019s it for now\u2026 "
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThe horn\u2026 Oh, the horn\u2026 It\u2019s probably my
    fault it ended in Dearion\u2019s hands\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DAs a fervent follower of Ammon, I paid a small fortune
    to get it from a travelling merchant. I\u2026 didn\u2019t belive it to be the
    actual thing until Ammon spoke to me.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DBut the horn is shattered now\u2026 I don\u2019t even remember
    how that came to be\u2026 So I was trying to get it and repair it! But I can
    never stay here for too long\u2026 I just can\u2019t reach it, no matter how
    hard I try.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DAmmon is feared and hated because Dearion belives something
    was done to him by Ammon\u2026 given what you told me, I assume he was right.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DOf course, I told Ammon of my worries and plights when
    he was still speaking to me\u2026 and Dearion\u2019s. I couldn\u2019t bare him
    seeing in such a state\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DBut\u2026 forgive me if the joke is not to your taste\u2026
    now I can\u2019t even remember why Dearion was in such conditions.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DHow ironic\u2026 it would be funny if it wasn\u2019t so
    sad\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "Well, that\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DMe and Dearion actually have known one another for some
    time now. I was a travelling performer that one day showed up to his court.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DHe liked my jokes and my demeanor, but liked the \u2018wisdom
    behind my eyes\u2019 better.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DEh\u2026 if he truly has lost his memory already\u2026
    I can certainly say that he wasn\u2019t any good at reading people\u2026 eheh\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThis is not funny at all\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "Well, that\u2019s it for now."
  - Do you want to insert the codes now? (Both of these codes are <b>CASE SENSITIVE</b>)
