  - 'After this strange conversation with Ammon, you feel a light tremor shaking
    your feet.  '
  - "Instinctively, you decide to take a step back, away from the wall. The tremor
    grows faster. In but a few moments, you hear a crumbling sound and a hail of
    small rocks pelts your front side\u2014 prompting you to instictively shield
    yourself with your arms. In a few longs seconds, the tremor stops and no rocks
    hit your face anymore. Only the choking smell of a cloud of dust and fine crushed
    rock invades your lungs.\nImmediately, you are hit with air even more stagnant
    and, surpringly enough, a light wind blowing from where the mosaic stands."
  - Approaching the wall in few careful steps and guiding yourself with your hands,
    you find with little shock that the entire wall as collapsed.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThat\u2026 was not supposed to happen. A door should have
    just slid open\u2026 for how long has this place been left unattended? This may
    be worse than I thought. </color>"
  - Ammon seemingly ignores your queries. His voice becomes quieter and quieter,
    until it disappears completely.
  - "Whatever he is thinking right now, is not good. If it can cause panic and confusion
    in a God\u2026 anything up ahead is surely important in solving all of this."
  - "As you place your hands on the sides of where the central mosaic was, you feel
    a steadily-narrowing rock tunnel. By going a few feet deep, you realize that
    you will have to proceed carefully and, most importantly, you won\u2019t have
    much wiggle room in here."
  - "You steady your breathing, focus your mind\u2026 and proceed inside the tunnel."
  - 'The jagged rocks that make up this old and decrepit place show that it is either
    unfisinished or rightfully never-used: it hurts to even walk in here. Every other
    step, the sharp edge of a rocky protrusion nips at your body, occasionally creating
    a tear in your clothing or a stining pain sensation in your body. Even walking
    as slow as possible does not prevent the tunnel from biting back with a hidden
    shank of natural material grazing your flesh and your appearal.'
  - "While on every other sense it is agonizing, your sense of smell is surpisingly
    relived: the light, natural breeze has been steadily growing from the faintest
    feeling of movement to a refreshing, if still quite low, current. Even through
    the occasional bout of pain, it keeps you going\u2026 it\u2019s certainly better
    than whatever stuffy air the crypt contained\u2026"
  - "This walk may not be long, but the short movements and glacial pace make it
    feel like it has been lasting for what feels like an eternity. Are you at least
    even reaching someplace useful? Well\u2026you were at the castle\u2019s lowest
    level when you entered\u2026 the only place you would need to move towards in
    the castle is up\u2026"
  - 'You painstakingly decide to test a theory. With the most care possible, you
    decide to reach low to the ground and see if you have been walking on an incline.
    Turns out, your observations were correct: a low, if barely percievable incline
    has allowed you to steadily climb out of your location.'
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou have been walking for a few minutes now.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThese tunnels\u2026 are not long. But for you, travelling
    around them feels almost eternal. That, I know. If only I had shared your caution,
    maybe none of this would have happened.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI must confess to you that the reason why Dearion fears
    me is justified. My powers are truly an awful thing.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThere is a certain presumptuosness that comes with power.
    Dearion knows this and you probably know how it affects men\u2014 you surely
    have been subject to it at some point in your life.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThose in power believe it is owed to them. They make excuses
    on why their actions are justified. They believe themselves heroes of their own
    story.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DGods and Men aren\u2019t so different after all.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI believed myself a merciful entity. I believe that what
    I brought was a gift\u2014 a cure for the malignance brewing in this kingdom.
    I\u2026 upheld their request. But those who wallow in pain seldom are searching
    for a solution\u2014 rather, an esape.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIt wasn\u2019t ignorance or maliciousness that brought
    me to do such an action\u2026 it was presumtuosness. I believed myself capable
    of fixing something that required no solution at all\u2014 I didn\u2019t cure
    the disease afflicting Dearion\u2019s heart; I simply removed the latter.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIt is in memory that one\u2019s character is built after
    all... What is a human if not a collection of memories?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DOnce again, I ask you not to beg for burden of proof on
    my part. Anything that comes out of my mouth doesn\u2019t hold the same value
    as actual evidence. I invite you to explore around the next room\u2026 I think
    that will clear any doubt you may have on this situation.\u201D</color>"
  - "Over the course of the next twenty or so minutes, you push your way through
    the unfinished passageway, progressively getting larger and larger\u2014 finally
    giving up enough space to allow you to stretch your arms fully."
  - "The tunnel you are In become more and more of a refined passageway as you walk
    through it. The occasional jagged edge poking you becomes less and less frequent,
    the barely scraped rock under your feet slowly turning into cobblestone, then
    brick\u2014 the air that makes its way through this entrance becoming a light,
    pleasant breeze."
  - As you keep making your way around the tunnel, it suddenly gives way to a larger
    room. You can feel its size by the echoing sound of your footsteps around here.
    The walls feel cool and slightly humid, made of some form of polished stone.
    Moving around the walls to make sense of the room reveals its hexagonal shape.
  - "Slowly inching towards the center of the room takes you some time, but reveals
    a smaller element of the room, sharing its shape with the latter and made of
    what you assume to be the same material. Feeling it with your hands, something
    far colder meets your hand\u2014 glass, of some sort, in a dome shape. Judging
    by its position, you wager this is some sort of display case."
  - You take some time to do a thourough investigation of the object in front of
    you. Tapping the dome a few times, you wager that it would be impossible to break
    it open. Its contents shall remain a mystery for you now.
  - The stone support reveals a few peculiarities. A small plate, similar to the
    previous ones you have encountered is available. However... there is a difference.
    The metal seems newer, its edge sharper and by the thickness of the plate it
    feels as if it was placed upon an original inscription on a  later date. You
    take some time to spell out its text.
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CShards of the Horn of Ammon. As Ammon betrayed
    Dearion in a vile, treacherous plot his nefarious artefacts stands here\u2014
    broken as the empty promises of the Great Enemy.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D...\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI had suspsected as much.\u201D</color>"
  - Ammon takes a few seconds to reply to you.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe Horn of Ammon is what binds me to him. I was summoned
    here by one of his faithful servants in hope I could cure him of his broken heart.
    The Horn of Ammon is the instrument that allowed for such act\u2026 but if it\u2019s
    broken\u2026 it means everything\u2019s lost.\u201D</color>"
  - You feel Ammon contemplating which words to choose, carefully.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion believes I betrayed him. Of course, he has no memory
    of the actual accident, I simply did as I was asked of him. In truth, it is my
    fault: I should have not did as they begged me to.\u201D</color>"
  - "Ammon\u2019s reflexive and calm tone shatters for a second, revealing an air
    of uncertainity"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe horn used to contain something extremely important\u2014
    Dearion\u2019s own memories. If it is broken, your job has gotten considerably
    harder. Convincing Dearion of his past memories will be nigh impossible.\u201D</color>"
  - Ammon reflects on his words for a moment.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWhile I\u2019m a god of memory, there are some things that
    are beyond me. Dearion\u2019s memories from our contract onwards are unreachable
    to me... I didn\u2019t know for certain he broke the Horn but I always suspected
    it.\u201D</color>"
  - "As you contemplate on the words professed to you\u2026 something interrupts
    your thinking."
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=25%>\u201COh Ammon, oh Ammon in your name I pray. Oh Ammon,
    oh Ammon please answer to me\u201D </color>"
  - ' A hushed, silent whisper can be faintly heard'
  - Concentrating at the best of your capabilities, you feel the whispering as if
    being carried from the wind, coming from the highest point of this room.
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=25%>\u201COh Ammon, oh Ammon in your name I pray. Oh Ammon,
    oh Ammon please answer to me\u201D </color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=75%>\u201COh Ammon, oh Ammon why have you forsaken me?
    Your prophet, your worshipper, the devout and the pious?\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=75%>\u201CIs it truly all lost? Is all of it gone and
    done? Why am I still praying in your name? Why am I still attached to the days
    past?\u201D</color>"

    there, not to mention the massive grate that is here too\u2026 unless you can
    squeeze through inches of metal\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DPoor Maurice. His part in this play has left his mind a
    bit lost...  </color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWe need to find a way to calm him down or else he\u2019ll
    probably rile up the entire castle\u2014 say this to him: Dearion will soon be
    cured.\u201D</color>"

  - <color=#7094db>"Oh what joyous day! Oh what wonderful miracle! All my praying
    has finally paid off! You are here! The one who Hosts Ammon! The new Keeper!"</color>

    like you my friend but my mind has become a bit\u2026 scattered after the past

  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYes. Dearion already used the Horn once. His memories were

    Dearion of his broken heart. </color>"
