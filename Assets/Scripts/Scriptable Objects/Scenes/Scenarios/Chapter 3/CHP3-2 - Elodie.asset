    <b>Elodie</b>'
  - You cautiously open the door in front of you. With very light resistance, the
    old wood once again creeks open. There is no sound initially coming to this room.
  - Your feet are almost elated from joy as you slightly sink within the floor of
    this room, as velvety carpet-like material makes the most of this room enjoyable
    to walk around.
  - "Even as you place your hands on the floor to confirm your suspicions, you notice
    something odd\u2014 while the door was considerably old, there is not a spec
    of dust on the floor. In fact, most of this room smells like a delicate perfume"
  - "By inhaling the air in the room a bit, you can pinpoint it to either apricot
    or peach. It\u2019s a very welcome change to the damp \u2013 if fresh \u2013
    air of the previous room, or the suffocatingly stuffy crypt."
  - "You begin making your way around this room by starting from its right side.
    Exploring the walls reveals that they have an internal wood finish, polished
    and waxed with care\u2014 no splinters or imperfections can be felt with your
    hands, at least on a first pass. Occasionally, you hit some extension of the
    wall, also made of wood. You figure it\u2019s some type of shelf, over which
    an assortment of items are placed\u2014 either cups, flowers, jewelry or other
    paraphenelia of sorts."
  - "Alongside all walls you feel no writing nor incisions, no secret messages or
    ways to proceed: uncannily enough, this seems just to be a normal room\u2026"
  - "\u2026where it not for its centerpiece."
  - "As you finish scanning the walls, you move closer to the center to examine the
    contents. Here, your feet bump against a wooden object\u2014 fairly tall and
    quite sturdy."
  - You crouch down to examine the base, a filled in rectangle that extends roughly
    two meters in length and one meter in width. Alongside it there are beautiful,
    intricate patterns carved in the wood.
  - "Attempting to examine the top of this centerpiece, your hand touches something
    that makes you recoil immediately\u2014 cold to the touch, yet bouncy and soft
    as skin. You go to touch it again."
  - "Once again, the reaction is offputting\u2014 but the initial shock has vanished,
    and some courage has been mustered. Progressing with your analysis, you realize
    that what you are touching is a freezing-cold human hand."
  - Your mind comes to think of the worst possibility but, as you begin to panic,
    the voice of Ammon settles in you mind.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DListen closely.\u201D</color>"
  - "An extremely faint breathing can be heard, slightly to your left\u2026 coming
    from the figure. The initial weirdness of an ice-cold sleeping person doesn\u2019t
    hit you immediately\u2014 what does is a wave of relief that the person in front
    of you is alive."
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DOh Elodie. What cruel faith has fate reserved you. Trapped
    forever in a lone mausoleum, hoping one day for someone \u2013 he who should
    remember you the most \u2013 to recall your name, your face, your smile.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DKeeper, this is Elodie of Deistella, wife and queen consort
    to Emperor Dearion.\u201D</color>"
  - "\u2026"
  - You feel a vibration from your pocket.
  - "You take out the bundled shards of the Horn of Ammon, trembling inside their
    silk container. As you attempt to pick up one of the pieces, it vibrates like
    a leaf on the wind\u2014 all of them do, reacting to the environment around you."
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe Horn is reacting to the memory it has taken from Dearion.
    The memory of Elodie, the memory of Shining Blades, of using the Horn\u2026 all
    of them you will need to put back inside. All of them will mend the Horn. This
    is where I trust your memory, Keeper.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DLeave the shards near this resting place, Keeper, and scout
    the room for information. To fix the horn, you require to write three glyphs:
    one to mend the horn\u2019s form, : one to take the memories from you and the
    last one to transfer them inside the horn once more. I used a similar incantation
    with Dearion before but this is much more complicated than that. The Horn will
    reveal what it seeks\u201D</color>"
  - "Placing your hands on the shards of the horn, you notice they re-arrange as
    you pass your finger through them\u2014 not by chance but with purpose, each
    passage a letter of a series of instructions."
  - 'Taking your time, you gather the following:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CShards of the Horn to fix, Shards of Memories
    to collect\u2014 just enough, just a few letter, just a number. Meld them together
    with purpose and sense and the Horn will follow suit.\u201D</mspace></color>"
  - Your objective is to mend the Horn of Ammon. To do so, you will need to inscrybe
    three glyphs containing fragments of the lost memories of Dearion. Search and
    explore the room to find them and ask Ammon about anything of interest.
  - You are currently residing in the center of the room, what would you like to
    do?
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201CThe most surface-level memories lost to Dearion
    need to be constructed first. Tell me shards about Shining Blades, about the
    people that have been lost, about why it started and why it ended.\u201D</mspace></color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>Write a glyph using them\u2014\r\nThe number of
    days Dearion waited for the enemy, the initials of the Title of the rival warlord,
    the first letter of each word said by Dearion to his enemy and the number of
    days the battle lasted. </mspace></color>\r\n"
  - "You place your hands on the horn, but you seemingly can\u2019t create the correct
    glyph. You will have to try again. "
  - You place your hands on the horn and, after uttering the correct words, you can
    feel pieces of the horn shape themselves back together.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou must do this incantation all at once, Keeper. The horn
    won\u2019t hold its shape otherwise.\u201D</color>"
  - 'With your hands still on the horn, a new sentence is spelled out:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CThe pact, the method Dearion used this instrument
    under the advice of a trusted person, how it ruined him and why he felt he had
    to.\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> Write a glyph using them\u2014\r\nThe initials
    of the one that adviced Dearion to use the Horn, the date that he used it on
    and the initials of the last words uttered before the Horn was used. </mspace></color>\r\n"
  - "You place your hands on the horn, but you seemingly can\u2019t create the correct
    glyph. You will have to try again. The forces that held up the Horn from the
    previous glyph dissipate. "
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDon\u2019t give up yet.\u201D</color>"
  - You keep your hands on the horn, and as you utter the correct words, you can
    feel even more pieces of the horn shape themselves back together.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou are almost done, don\u2019t give up now!\u201D</color>"
  - 'The remaining fragments spell out one last sentence:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> \u201CThe time before. The secrets of Dearion\u2014
    give back his most important memory\u201D </mspace></color>"
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9> Write a glyph using that\u2014\r\nThe intial letters
    of Elodie\u2019s curse, each initial of Dearion\u2019s promise to her and the
    Date Dearion met Elodie. </mspace></color>\r\n"
  - "With a last sigh you utter your words, but you seemingly can\u2019t create the
    correct glyph. The horn dismantles and returns in its original position."
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou are very close. I believe in you.\u201C</color>"
  - You finish your sentence and hear the Horn's shape shift...
  - Exploring around the room reveals a few shelves, four to be precise, scattered
    around the room. One on each different wall.
  - 'On the western shelf, a series of various artefacts and baubles can be felt.
    You pick up what appears to be a medal of sort. Its metal indentation is small
    and it takes you some time to actually spell out its contents:'
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201DTo the honour of Barristan Roszce, hero of
    Shining Blades. He charged first into the fray after the King\u2019s command:
    \u201Clet cruel Conquerors reason in Blood\". May he find an afterlife where
    he is honoured as the hero he was.\u201D</mspace></color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "On the northern shelf, a collection of books can be found. Various papers are
    also scattered about, and you can feel a few glass containers spread about. You
    assume this is either a collection of alchemical notes or some sort of study
    area. Unfortunately enough, these books are not written in braile, so you can\u2019t
    gain their informations."
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - On the southern shelf, a plaque commemorates an event. You grab it from its shelf
    and, laying on the ground, start examining its contents.
  - "\u201CThe day where Ammon will free my mind, where I will be able to rule again
    for the good of the Kingdom: the 24th day of the 3rd month. This plaque acts
    as my will in case my mind goes astray, or I do not survive the divine intervention.
    Let this kingdom in the hands of Maurice Delaroe, his cunning and wisdom did
    not doom me, but will lead me to be a better ruler for all. I\u2019m done being
    the one to whom sacrifices are owed\u2014 it is time I take my own.\u201D"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026 I can see why Dearion suspected Maurice of betraying
    him. If you had no memory of the events that occurred, wouldn\u2019t you believe
    this is a forgery made by Maurice to take control of the castle?\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026 still, Dearion viewed all this as a sacrificed he
    needed to take. He truly believed everyone else had given up so much, and him
    so little\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "On the eastern shelf, a collection of various soft items can be found. You pick
    up one or two of them, and squish them near your chest. These feel quite comforting
    and soft to hold\u2026 You wonder what they are."
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI believe I have the answer to that.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAfter Shining Blades, the King was honoured once again
    as a paragon of virtue and heroism. The populace felt like they needed to repay
    him somewhat\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIn honour of his fallen friends, the local seamstress made
    him two soft stuffed dolls of his beloved comrades, to place next to Elodie\u2019s
    bed so that they may protect her in her endless dreams.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DEven such acts of comfort weren\u2019t capable of helping
    the King\u2014 he viewed each and every gift as further proof that he was an
    egoist for not enduring the sacrifice people expected him to.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "At the center of the room lies what you have now identified as a wooden bed.
    No mattress or softness can be found here\u2026 and given the conditions of its
    occupant its more of a coffin than a bed."
  - Still thinking about the details of her case, you can't help but feel sorry for
    her situation.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DLet Elodie rest eternally. Focus on other details.\u201C</color>"
  - As you once again examine the wooden support structure, you realize some of the
    carvings are actually a small inscryption.
  - "<mspace=0.5em><color=#d9d9d9>\u201DHere lies Elodie of Deistella, sole daughter
    of the Exile King of Deistella. May his fate not follow her, and his accursed
    dealings be the end of him. She paid the price of a bad bargain instead of her
    treacherous father\u2014 with no fault of her own. Let my solemn promise be forever
    here: <i>\u2018Your dreams will Not be Eternal\u2019</i>.\r\nSigned, Dearion
    of Sheon\u201D </mspace></color >\r\n"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026 even if she can\u2019t wake anymore, let\u2019s
    make sure her memory is never forgotten.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DOf course, I\u2019m happy to assist. What do you wish to
    discuss?\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DTake your time.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI\u2026 never knew Elodie personally. By the time I was
    contacted by Maurice she was already asleep.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DOf course I did have access to her memories, but I never
    truly looked deep within them. I didn\u2019t want them to change my mind on helping
    Dearion.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIf I did it before my grievous act, it may have ended differently.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI may be able to help you with some of the details of them\u2014but
    not all of them. Memories aren\u2019t perfect, after all\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DMh, it\u2019s somewhat amusing. Dearion was always terrible
    at remembering dates\u2026 but he definetly did remember about this one.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThey met at a gala when Dearion was still small nobility.
    At the time, Elodie was already a princess of a kingdom\u2026 she wouldn\u2019t
    remain that for long however. A few years later, revolution would hit her country
    by storm and her dad, the then-king, would be forced into exhile.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DOf course the two hit it off well to start, but no matter
    how charming Dearion was, Elodie\u2019s father would have never consented to
    marriage into small nobility. The only suitor she would be allowed to choose
    would be one to expand her kingdom\u2014 not reduce its influence.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DHowever, the two kept sending letters to one another in
    secret. A true forbidden love story, of two young people destined to be separated.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWhen her dad went into exhile and revolutionairres occupied
    their palace, she fled the city with a horse and her clothes\u2014 nothing else,
    not even a bite of bread for the road.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DShe rode her all the way here, past the sands of Hikidima,
    past Shining Blades Pass\u2026 to end up, half-starved, to Dearion\u2019s door.
    Her first words to him were \u2018Sorry I didn\u2019t bring a Gift.\u2019\u2026
    and then she fainted.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DCan you imagine that? Dearion was worried sick about her.
    I can vividly describe the anguish he was feeling, the panic for his beloved\u2026
    only for her to say a quip and then immediately faint at his doorstep.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAnyway, Dearion made a point to celebrate both their first
    meeting and their reunion. The grand gala was the 24th day of the 8th month of
    the year 1325. Then next they were reunited the 11th day of the 2nd month of
    the year 1330\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D...\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DSigh...\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThese memories were truly beloved by Dearion once. I still
    cannot fathom how much it must have hurt losing Elodie\u2026 to the point of
    cleansing your mind from even these joyous moments.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion turned every corner of the World to search more
    information about this. I have a very clear picture.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DElodie appears to be under the effects of a potent primordial
    spell, the magic of hags or witches. She apparently was cursed with a blossom
    of a spell, which matured as she grew older. By the time she met Dearion, her
    fate was sealed.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe spell gave her unnaturally cold skin, long bouts of
    torpor and made her unable to sire children. But none of the terrible effects
    of the spell matched its awful completion\u2014 eternal sleep.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe spell was cast on her when she was but a child, after
    her father, now an exile king, slighted a powerful hag. The name of this powerful
    spell is the <i>\u201CCurse of Frozen Rest\u201C</i></color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DOf course, the nature of the spell is what makes it hard
    to reverse it. It may even have been completely irreversible when Dearion made
    his deal with me \u2026 and by now it\u2019s for sure an impossible feat.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DPlease, try to avert your mind from searching solutions
    to this problem. I can\u2019t allow you to make the same mistake Dearion made\u2014
    forgetting the past is as bad as endlessly chasing it. You must remember it but
    be content with the fact that it may never be back.\u201D</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion and Elodie were inseparable. Truly a couple sent
    by the Divine to rule as a just pair of monarchs. They complemented each other
    so much that other rulers were afraid of them, some even trying to emulate their
    relationship with their wives or husbands in turn.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DBut truly, Dearion and Elodie were one of a kind.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion held Elodie in the highest regard. They truly where
    happy together. Which is why it hurt him so to forever lose her. A sad affair
    that one.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion loved Elodie as much as he loved his Kingdom and
    the Kingdom loved Elodie as much as Dearion did. She was radiant, charming and
    smart\u2014 helped Dearion in some of the hardest choices. Whenever a moral compass
    was needed Elodie was the woman for the job.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWhen she was gone\u2026 Dearion was emotionally lost\u2014
    how can man weight love against duty? All men, women and children were mourning
    her loss too\u2026 but they all turned to the Emperor for help.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion felt a budding resentment towards his populace\u2014
    he was more at loss than them and yet they required his attention and power,
    some even attempted to extract money or information from his weakened mental
    state.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DEffectively a widower, the image of Elodie was used against
    him more than once\u2014 and Dearion caved, always. Some people have no qualms
    in exploiting the sick or the dead for their benefit and the mere mention of
    his wife cracked open his fa\xE7ade as a stern but just ruler, showing nothing
    more than a mourning man.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201D\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DTell me Keeper. Was I in the wrong? Should I have just
    not\u2026 helped him?\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI suppose you are right. For how my power is strong, my
    understanding of mortals is\u2026 limited. Most people paint memories in colours
    of their choice and from them alone it is hard to gauge the truth of a situation,
    or the complexities therein.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThank you for your answer.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI... wasn\u2019t expecting this answer. I guess the consequences
    of such an action were unforseen even to me\u2026 but does it justify my carelessness?
    Isn\u2019t it the duty of the divine to aid the mortal? Or is this the same logical
    fallacy that brought Dearion to seek help from me, as his populace sought help
    from him? I suppose the damage is done but the blame rests on none\u2026\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThank you for your answer.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIndeed. I turned to you for guidance on the matter but
    it seems the matter is very much not easy to solve.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThank you for your answer.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion was not as cruel as you may have come to know him
    now. In fact, some would say he was too kind as a ruler.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion cared about his people, and he cared enough about
    them to sully out to the field of battle himself\u2014 Shining Blades was the
    last time he did so.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion\u2019s kingdom was prosperous, but after Elodie
    entered the final stage of her spell\u2026 saying Dearion was distraught would
    be an understatement. The man was an emotional wreck. He could barely hold audience
    to his subjects, the more cunning of them exploiting this weakness for profit
    or benefits.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DBut all them were naught but small fish gathering around
    the carcass of a king\u2014 the blood of the kingdom was in the water and, sooner
    or later, sharks would follow.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DVoices of a weak teary-eyed king who could barely hold
    his subject together spread fast amongst those who deal in the game of power
    and thrones\u2014 especially interested are those who own armies but no kingdom
    of their own. Scoundrels, Tyrants, Conquerors\u2014 Warlords.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DMake no mistake: war was inevitable\u2014 such is the nature
    of kingdom politics. The question was not if the banners would fly, only when
    and which colours. Subjects were already leaving the kingdom, or cutting deals
    of inside information of anything relevant with the ever-contending Lords.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAnd of all the carrion-eaters, the worst of them all shows
    up to the doorsteps: Zung Recok-ket. Known as \u201Cthe Early Dawn\u201D by most,
    he commands one of the most ferocious bands of mercenaries the World has ever
    seen. At best, sellswords of dubious honour\u2026 at worse, nomad carnifex of
    the worst kind, with no alliegance but coin.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWhen voices of the impeding war started spreadng, even
    the most loyal of subjects were afraid. Dearion did not care about anything,
    and hoped to never wake from the day of the attack. But a small part of himself
    worked against apathic surrender\u2014 a small sign that maybe, the Dearion people
    knew was still there with them.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIn a never-to-be-seen move, Dearion moved against its grief
    and heartache to personally lead the troops to battle. Never had the kingdom
    been in such ecstatic turmoil: the King was back and he would defend them personally
    from the attack!\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAfter the declaration of war had arrived to the doorsteps
    of the Palace, the King was already fitted for war. He waited next to four months,
    115 days to be precise, for the enemy to arrive.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DShining Blades was a terrifying display of competence and
    strategic use of terrain, if it was remembered by any it would be part of the
    curriculum of any tactician worth of note. In but 4 days, the defending forces
    repelled a collective army that outnumbered them 25 to 1.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DBarristan\u2019s strategic advise, alongside Junia\u2019s
    magical scouting and the King\u2019s split-second decision to divert the enemy
    forces into a naturally formed chokehold proved to be decisive factors that turned
    the tide in the favour of the Kingdom. Zung had to retreat with no kingdom conquered
    and much of his brutes left without pay nor honor. Some say he was executed by
    his own man, others say that he ran away with what measly sum they raided from
    the villages and towns on their way to Shining Blades Pass.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe kingdom was safe\u2026 but at what cost? Two of his
    best men\u2014 two of his friends lost in that battle and almost 400 men killed.
    His lack of strength caused this, Dearion believed\u2026 he was ready to take
    any measure necessary to stop this from happening ever again.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWhile the King outwardly appeared cured\u2026 his mental
    wellbeing was steadily declining, maybe even worse than before. When first he
    met opportunist scavengers with what they desired, they\u2019d now be thrown
    into dungeons or worse, sent to the gallows. And with these displays of strength,
    he was simply masking the endless nights of crying in this very room.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DIt would be hard to not notice his steady decline as a
    true friend\u2026 and even worse not intervening . That\u2019s when Maurice told
    me about Dearion\u2019s plight\u2026 and when I decided to fix it myself.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI removed all of his memories about Elodie. All of his
    memories of Shining Blades\u2026 and the conditions of our deal. I thought that
    removing the memories would cause him to return as he once was\u2026 that was
    not the case.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion\u2019s sorrow persisted, but now it had no clear
    source or reference anymore. This mausoleum became abbandoned, these halls lost
    in the Palace forever. He feels to this day a terrible sense of discomfort, rage
    and sadness\u2026 but nothing can fix it\u2014 what caused it in him is not there
    anymore. He waits for an enemy that he has already defeated, for he has no memory
    of Shining Blades. He grieves for a person that in his mind no longer exists.</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe only memories he has is that he has done a deal with
    me\u2026 and now feels this way. Judging by the information he has, it\u2019s
    not hard to see why he reacted the way he did, why he outlawed my name, why he
    hates me so. I don\u2019t blame him at all\u2026 He made this reasoning with
    the means I left him after all.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThis room is a mausoleum, a recreation of Dearion and Elodie\u2019s
    room back in the small manor of the now-King. It contains trinkets and baubles
    of events past, a sort of \u2018remembrance room\u2019 if you will.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DYou cannot even begin to imagine Dearion\u2019s confusion
    when he saw this room without his memories. He believed this entire place to
    be cursed, a mockery built by me of a fate that never happened. He ordered it
    sealed\u2026 but forgot a few entrances.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion hates me, but he isn\u2019t fool enough to not
    respect the power of a God. Destroying all of this, in his own mind, would have
    incured my wrath\u2026 but one item he wanted to destroy, the symbol of this
    curse I placed upon him\u2014 the Horn. After its destruction, I can no longer
    recall anything of this kingdom, nor can I contact people other than you.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DGiven its significance, maybe you can explore around this
    room a bit more to find more memories to reforge the Horn with.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThe Horn is an artifact that, a very long time ago, was
    blessed in my name. I used to be more popular amongst mortals a long time ago\u2026
    but somehow even the God of memory can be forgotten.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDespite what Maurice belives, I\u2019m not eternal\u2014
    no god truly is. We exist as long as someone belives in our existence. I\u2019ve
    seen countless others of my kin cease existing because their names I could no
    longer recall.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DThat day will come for me too. As the keeper of Memory,
    I don\u2019t worry much about it\u2014 a new God will pick up my mantle, and
    I welcome them in the challenge.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DStill\u2026 the day the Horn was activated is something
    I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever forget. Dearion asked audience with me personally.
    As he held the horn, he whispered these words: \u201CLend me Strength, enough
    to save my Kingdom.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DDearion truly must have been desperate\u2026\u201D </color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DWhat more is there to say about me? I\u2019m a divine entitiy,
    a construct made by humans for humans to symbolize their memory and ability to
    recall. I exist as long as people remember me, as all ideas do.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI belive Maurice described my existence and ultimately
    end of it as \u2018ironic\u2019, I\u2019m inclined to agree.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DJust know that for the time being, I\u2019ll stick out
    with you.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DMaurice Delaroe is a kind man and carried the title of
    Keeper before you did.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DHe\u2019s an empathic man, but do not be dissuaded by his
    courtly jester act. The man is far smarter than he looks and knew of Dearion\u2019s
    situation. Truthfully, it hurts to know that Dearion no longer trusts him.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DBoth of them sense something towards me. Maurice devolved
    into insanity and zelotry, Dearion in rage and disdain: however, Dearion senses
    there is something off about the Jester. He doesn\u2019t remember that he suggested
    to speak with Ammon to my request, but a sense of hatred is pervaded into him.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DEven with his mind in this sorry state, the Jester still
    is trickingly cunning and a champion of the art of the word\u2014 Dearion cannot
    truly discern his intentions or words and the Jester keeps his worship secret
    to everybody.\u201C</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DHis faith is the only thing he has left: the kingdom in
    ruin, his friend suspecting him of treason and his God now forever absent\u2026
    that type of devotion is truly without equal.\u201C</color>"
  - "That\u2019s it for now\u2026"
  - You take in deep breaths. You start scrambling to find the fragments of what
    once was the Horn of Ammon... but can't find anything any smaller shards. Your
    hands instead meet a newly finished form, a long horn that follows the shape
    of a spiral... the Horn of Ammon.
