  - In front of you, covered by thick shards of whatever material protected them,
    stand the shards of the Horn of Ammon.
  - "A quick scan with your hands reveal that a number of fragments are amongst this
    pile. The sensation you felt when touching it didn\u2019t match your expectations\u2014
    an extremely cold feel from the object, texture and roughness similar to bone.
    The shards you can collect are farily large, but judging by the size of each
    fragment you take in your hands, the horn must not be bigger than half a meter
    in length."
  - You carefully collect each piece, noticing as you are feeling your way around
    the display to find more pieces that a small piece of silk was what they rested
    on. You decide that to keep the pieces all together you can bundle them in that
    drape. Taking some time to collect everything and double checking that no pieces
    have been dropped or are missing, you collect all the remains of the Horn of
    Ammon.
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DRecovering the pieces of the Horn is just one of the steps
    I\u2019m afraid.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DNow comes the mater of suturing it back together.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI gather you probably guessed how by now...\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DAs the inscryption of the pedistal read, there is one more
    room beyond this one...\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DHowever, how to access it is beyond me. I have no idea
    if there even is a door in this room\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DI think I do, actually.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DThere is a lever right next to this grate. Judging by the
    mechanism on it, it used to be a part of a magical elevator that reached all
    the way up here\u2026 the display at the very least. I\u2019m not good with machinery,
    much less magical ones so I never managed to fix it.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DBut I do know that this thing can also go further down!\u201D</color>"
  - With a thunderous sound, a humming begins to emit from the floor which, almost
    imperceptably, seems to descend further and further below. A light scraping of
    rock on rock suggests that this entire platform is moving ever closer to your
    goal.
  - "<color=#7094db>\u201DIf you can fix the Horn, Ammon can just contact me again!
    When that happens, I\u2019ll see if I can help you get out!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=75%>\u201DFor now you\u2019ll have to do this by yourself!
    Discover the truth that Dearion has willingly forgotten!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=50%>\u201DI\u2019m counting on you!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=25%>\u201DAhahahahahaahahahah!\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=25%>\u201D\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=25%>\u201D\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#7094db> <size=25%>\u201D\u2026\u201D</color>"
  - "The Jester can no longer be heard. The platform has moved too far away from
    its original location. In a quick attempt to gain information on the next location,
    you begin to move your hands across the wall\u2014 the brickwork giving way to
    full slabs of polished stone, perfectly even under your touch."
  - The travel progresses,silently, for a few minutes. No words are exchanged between
    you an Ammon at this time. Just contemplating your situation.
  - "Then, suddenly, the contraption stops\u2014 coming to a slow, grinding end.
    Quickly, you start scanning the walls for some sort of opening\u2014 an unlocked
    wooden door with an intricate handle of an unknown material."
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DI suggest you brace yourself for what you will see.\u201D</color>"
  - "<color=#00e64d>\u201DLet\u2019s put an end to this mistake, once and for all.\u201D</color>"
